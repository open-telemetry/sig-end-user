This document is intended to outline best practices for long running and durable OpenTelemetry community surveys. 

The OpenTelemetry community would like to gather data about end-users including their experiences, preferences, perceptions and opinions about OpenTelemetry. This data can be used to inform priorities within various OpenTelemetry projects.

# Community survey best practices

### Community survey principles
- User feedback should be a mix of qualitative and quantitative:
  - Qualitative to validate/invalidate hypotheses
  - Quantitative to set a baseline for key results and segment customers
- All user feedback will be collected anonymously except direct customer interviews
- Raw data should be transparent to the community/world
- The end user working group will reach consensus on key milestones, including:
  - Recurring/perpetual survey design
  - Survey Hypotheses
  - Measuring Key Results
  - Survey Best Practices
  - Summarizing and reporting results

### Survey reminders: 
- Be respectful of the survey-takers' time, in general try to keep the survey short in duration, with specific and targeted questions. You can always ask if you can follow up with them to get deeper context.
- We want to measure improvements too, so using trendable questions helps us assess how we’re doing 
- We encourage mix of general and targeted surveys

### Helpful questions and considerations: 

- Audience identification: 
   - Who will participate in the survey? What is their user role?
  - Do you need any segmentation or demographic information to meet your survey goals?
  - How many participants do you need for success? 
- Establish survey intent & goals:
  - What are you looking to learn/identify/measure?
  - How will the data be used?
  - What are the survey key results?
- Crafting survey questions: 
  - What is the problem/feedback you want to gather data on?
  - Should you be looking for quantitative or qualitative information, or both?
- Distribution channels: 
  - Where will the survey be advertised?
  - How will end-users be invited to participate? 
- How do you plan to analyze & distribute the survey responses: 
  - How will the data be reported? 
  - What can be summarized? 
  - Do you have any conclusions, insights or recommendations?

### Basic survey template

Surveys header information should include:

* Purpose of the survey
* How long the survey will be open (usually one month)

All surveys should included the following basic demographics questions:

- How large is your organization? (options: 0-50, 50-100, 100-1000, >1000)
- What industry do you work in? (options: Technology, Manufacturing, Aerospace, Retail, Finance, Healthcare, Automotive, Hospitality, Research, Travel & Leisure, Media, Advertisement, other)
- What type of team do you work on? (options: Dev, DevOps, Operations, SRE, Platform Engineering, Observability, Sysadmin, Sales Engineering, DevRel, other)
- Do you work for a vendor? (options: yes/no)
- Are you running this in Production? (option: yes/no)
- Where in your Observability journey is your organization? (options: Beginner - Learning about observability / Have used monitoring tools; Intermediate - We are setting up an observability practice; Expert - We have a well-established observability practice)
