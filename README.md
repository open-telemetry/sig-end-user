## What is the End-User SIG?

There are two primary goals of the End-User SIG:
* Foster a sense of vendor-agnostic community for OpenTelemetry end-users to promote learning and adoption. We currently accomplish this through: [CNCF Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01RT3MSWGZ), [panels](https://youtube.com/@otel-official) and blog posts.
* Facilitate the collection and communication of end-user feedback to OpenTelemetry project special interest groups to influence SIG priorities. We currently accomplish this through: creation and maintenance of end-user research assets such as OpenTelemetry Community surveys & organization and facilitation of structured end-user interview sessions.

Our group discourages promotion of vendor-specific solutions and desires to keep the focus on OpenTelemetry core technologies, adoption and usage.

## Get Involved

There are many ways to get involved in our work! We (End-User SIG) meet every two weeks on Thursdays at 10:00 PT/13:00 ET/19:00 CET. Check out the [OpenTelemetry Community calendar](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community?tab=readme-ov-file#calendar) for the Zoom link and any updates to this schedule.

Meeting notes are available as a [public Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e-UNZA3Tuno9b53RQbe--whUcO0VIXF3P81oXsrBK6g). If you have trouble accessing the doc, please get in touch on [Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01RT3MSWGZ).

As an end user, you may want to:
