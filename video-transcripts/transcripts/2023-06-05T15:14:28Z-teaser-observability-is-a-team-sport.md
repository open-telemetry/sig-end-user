## Summary

In this video, the speaker discusses the concept of observability as a collaborative effort within teams, advocating for a shift away from the traditional model where dedicated observability teams handle all aspects of monitoring and alerting. The speaker emphasizes that engineers are most familiar with their own code and products and should take an active role in observability practices. Instead of solely relying on observability teams to create guidelines and respond to alerts, the speaker believes in empowering engineers to lead these efforts, with observability engineers providing support and tools. The video aims to encourage a more inclusive approach to observability in software development.

# Observability as a Team Sport

The topic I want to discuss today is **observability as a team sport**. This is something I am extremely passionate about. 

In many companies, observability teams are responsible for creating guidelines, instrumenting the code, setting up alerts, and responding to them. However, I am completely against this approach. I believe that **observability should be a shared responsibility**. 

Engineers are the ones who know their code and product best. As observability engineers, our role should be to **help and empower** them by providing the necessary tools, rather than taking charge of this aspect. 

That's the core message I want to convey today.

foreign topic will be observability as a team sport it's something that I'm extremely passionate about and I see that in many companies observability teams are the ones that are making the guidelines instrumenting the code creating the alerts and responding to them and I am completely against that I think that observability everyone should do their part Engineers know their code and their product better us as a durability Engineers are there to help them and Empower them and provide the tools but they should be the one taking charge when it comes to to this part so that's what I'm going to be talking about and
