## Summary

In this video, the speaker discusses the concept of observability as a collaborative effort within teams, emphasizing that it should not be solely the responsibility of dedicated observability teams. The speaker, who is passionate about this topic, argues that engineers should take ownership of observability in their code and products, while observability engineers should act as facilitators, providing tools and support. The main points include the importance of empowering engineers to handle observability and the need for a collective approach rather than a top-down model.

[00:00:10] **Speaker:** Foreign topic will be observability as a team sport. It's something that I'm extremely passionate about. 

[00:00:20] I see that in many companies, observability teams are the ones that are making the guidelines, instrumenting the code, creating the alerts, and responding to them. I am completely against that. I think that observability, everyone should do their part. Engineers know their code and their product better. 

[00:00:40] Us as observability engineers are there to help them and empower them and provide the tools, but they should be the ones taking charge when it comes to this part. So that's what I'm going to be talking about.
