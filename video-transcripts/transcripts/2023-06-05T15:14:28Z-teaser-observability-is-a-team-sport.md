## Summary

In this video, the speaker passionately discusses the concept of observability as a collaborative effort within software engineering teams. They express their belief that observability should not be solely the responsibility of dedicated observability teams, who typically create guidelines, instrument code, and manage alerts. Instead, the speaker advocates for a more inclusive approach where all engineers take an active role in observability, leveraging their deep understanding of the code and product. The speaker emphasizes the importance of empowering engineers with the necessary tools, positioning observability as a shared responsibility among the entire team.

**Speaker:** I am completely against that. I think that observability, everyone should do their part. Engineers know their code and their product better. Us as observability engineers are there to help them and empower them and provide the tools, but they should be the one taking charge when it comes to this part. 

**Speaker:** So that's what I'm going to be talking about.
