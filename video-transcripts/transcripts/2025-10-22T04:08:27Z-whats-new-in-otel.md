### [00:00:00] Introductions

**Bree:** Heat. Heat. Hello.

**Adriana:** Hello everyone. Welcome.

**Bree:** Welcome. If you're on Pacific time like me, it's early 8:00 AM. Still dark. Thank you for joining if you're on Pacific time.

**Adriana:** You're welcome.

**Bree:** Well, hi. Welcome to this special edition of Open Telemetry and User Sig Live. We're very excited to bring to you a brand new segment called What's New in Hotel. I am Bree Lee. I'm a senior developer relations engineer at New Relic. I get to work with the lovely Adriana Villa. Would you like to introduce yourself?

**Adriana:** Yes. My name is Adriana Vila. I work with Bree in the hotel and user SIG and I am a principal developer advocate at Dynatrace. Like Bree said, this is our very first What's New in Hotel. I think this is really exciting because I don't know about you, but for me, I can never keep up with all the stuff that's going on in hotel. So I kind of need someone to tell me. This is a little self-serving and we're basically bringing folks in from the hotel community to tell us some of the cool stuff that is going on.

**Bree:** Yes. And hello, Michael.

**Michael:** Hi. Yay. Thanks for joining us. I know it's lateish for you.

**Bree:** It's way 5:00 PM for you. So, thank you for joining, Michael.

**Michael:** Yes. And by the way, I am coming in from Portland, Oregon. If you would like to share where you're tuning in from in the chat of whichever app you're using, we would love to see where you're from because there's a pretty good variety of time zones on this call as well.

**Adriana:** For example, I am coming from Toronto.

**Bree:** That's right. Yeah. And you said it right. You said Toronto, not Toronto.

**Adriana:** Amazing. Yes, I'm from Canada, so representing.

**Bree:** So I guess this is a good time to bring in our first guest.

**Adriana:** Oh yeah, sorry. Sorry. Yes. 

**Bree:** Just to give you all a sneak peek into what our new segment is going to look like, we are going to speak with Severin Newman. Then we're going to speak with Marilia Gutierrez. Finally, we are going to bring on Lisa Jung to host our audience Q&A at the very end. If you have questions, put them in the chat and we will get to them at the end of both of the first two interviews during the audience Q&A. Hopefully that'll make sense. Yes, like Adriana said, let's bring on Severin.

**Severin:** Hey, happy to be here.

**Bree:** Thanks for joining us.

**Severin:** Yeah, sure. Where are you coming to us live from?

**Bree:** I'm based in Germany, so I'm close to Nuremberg. 

**Adriana:** So it's evening for you.

**Severin:** Yeah, it's 5:00 PM. It's getting dark again. Summer is officially over unfortunately.

**Bree:** And then next week you guys get the time change of 1 hour back and then North America gets the time change of 1 hour back this week because it's screwing up my whole calendar. Everything is now at 5:00 PM which should be at 6:00 PM. 

**Severin:** Yeah, let's get over it. 

**Bree:** Well, at least we have one more week of not having to worry about that.

**Severin:** Yeah.

**Bree:** Do you want to introduce yourself briefly?

**Severin:** Yeah, sure. I'm Severin, however you pronounce it; I also pronounce it differently when I speak English or German. I'm head of community and developer relations at Cosley. I'm part of the Open Telemetry governance committee and I'm also one of the co-maintainers of what we call sigcoms. What we do is the website, the blog, the social media channels, and everything around that. That's a very short version of what I do for the Open Telemetry community. I'm super excited to be here today to give you a first start into what's new in Open Telemetry. So yeah, that's me.

**Bree:** Amazing. So I guess let's get started then. Do you have some goodies that you can share with us?

**Severin:** Yeah, absolutely. I have prepared a little bit of slides not to bore everybody out with a lot of text, but more to make a few of these things I wanted to share with you a little more visual. I have three topics to talk about: a little bit about hotel and numbers because I'm always excited about seeing how big this project has grown, a little bit about the community, and then a little bit about the tech stuff. I think that's the stuff that most people are excited about. So yeah, let me share my screen and get started with a little bit on the numbers. 

**Severin:** So those numbers are like for all the time, right? Since Open Telemetry was created, what is it now, 6 years ago? We had almost 20,000 contributors from 120 countries and almost 2,000 organizations. I also looked up the numbers for the last 12 months which is still like 6,000 contributors over 70 countries and over 600 organizations. You see there's a lot of velocity in our project, right? This is growing every year and we see it also with the PRs and the work that's happening on GitHub. We have to add here right something like this session here is not recorded by anything that you see on CNCF Devstat; there's a lot of work going on in our community that's not tracked on those boards unfortunately. 

**Severin:** Also, a big shout out to everybody doing the work outside of the repositories, but I still think those numbers are impressive. Since the foundation of the project, we had like those 60,000 PRs reviewed; as you can see, most of them three to four times and then over half a million comments. That means there were over half a million times someone wrote something on a below our issue or pull request or something like that, which I think is really great. 

**Severin:** What's really exciting is like in the last year, I think 20% of those PRs have been just done in the last year, which is huge growth and especially like from the reviews, 30% of them have been done in the last year meaning we're leveling up our reviews. We have more and more repositories where we say, "Hey, you're not done with one review; you maybe need two reviews." For example, in our Open Telemetry IO repository, we need a review from docs maintainers and from the co-owners sig. I think this really helps with the quality of the project. 

**Severin:** And who's doing that, right? This is a number I'm super happy to be able to share because we built a page for that specifically on the Open Telemetry website where we list all the triagers, all the approvers, and all the maintainers. As you can see, those are people that stepped up and took over a role where they said, "Hey, I help with triaging. I help with managing the repositories. I help with running the SIG meetings." If you do the math, there's almost 300 people just having those kinds of roles, which I think is really, really great to have. A big shout out to everybody who's helping with that and also a big shout out to all the people I'm not listing here because there are so many people in our community that are helping or that just land in our community and then wanting to step up and do much more things.

### [00:10:12] Discussion about OpenTelemetry community growth

**Severin:** Then of course, who is using Open Telemetry, right? There's always like three kinds of groups that we mention: first of all, of course, the vendors or the backends. This is of course companies that consume Open Telemetry data and do something with it, but also open source projects. This also includes Jaeger or OpenSearch. Then there's also what we call integrations. That number is probably much bigger. This is just what we have on our website. Those are projects that said, "Hey, we add Open Telemetry to our project natively." Things like Kubernetes has their API server supporting Open Telemetry or there's the PHP server called Roadrunner that has Open Telemetry. I always love mentioning that one because it's written in Go and then doing PHP, so you can even do tracing from Go into the PHP in this web server. I think that's also very fun. 

**Severin:** And then of course thousands of adopters. I mean every time I'm in a presentation or in a room and I ask people, "Hey, who of you knows about Open Telemetry?" most of their hands go up. Then if I say, "Hey, and who of you is using Open Telemetry?" also like 80% of the people are raising their hand. Unfortunately, this is something we don't have that many listed on our website. Here’s the first call to action: if you are an Open Telemetry adopter, if you have maybe even written a blog from your company where you say, "Hey, here's how we use Open Telemetry. Here's how it's helping us," just use that link, and you can reach out, and we can have you add it there. 

**Severin:** That's a little bit Open Telemetry numbers. I think that's just a good starting point and let's talk about the community or is there anything you'd like to deep dive on that slide? 

**Adriana:** I think let's dive into the next topic.

**Severin:** Awesome. I think that's now more exciting. I always love to start with those numbers to just emphasize how big this community has grown. That also means there's a lot of community updates and especially like we all know KubeCon is coming. For whatever reasons, September, October, November is like all those community changes that are going on. One I'd like to highlight, because I'm one of the maintainers of this project, is if you go to the OpenTelemetry.io website, there's now nine languages that we have started to translate the OpenTelemetry website to. This includes English just like the base language, but then we have Bengali, Spanish, French, Japanese, Portuguese, Romanian, Ukrainian, and Chinese. I have written it down so that I don't forget anybody. I think that's amazing. We started with that a little bit more than a year ago with four languages and it has grown to nine languages. This is really amazing community because I think that's a really great way to get started with Open Telemetry, right? You can translate the things into your native language, learn about them, and then maybe move into different projects of the OpenTelemetry project with this additional understanding.

**Severin:** A big call out: the technical committee has added two members. David Ashpole and Josh McDonald have joined the TC. David is a subject matter expert on metrics Prometheus. He's a Kubernetes contributor as well. Josh has stepped down from the TC a while ago and is now coming back in. He's in the sampling SIG. He is one of the people behind the OpenTelemetry Arrow and so many other things. I'm probably not doing him justice only calling out those two things, but yeah, big congratulations to the two for joining the TC and we will see the impact they will have on the project very soon.

**Severin:** Another one: the governance committee election is coming up next week. We just announced the candidates. If you are a member of standing, as we call it in the OpenTelemetry community, you should have a notification about being allowed to elect. If you think that you're allowed to be in that election as a voter and have not gotten your access to that, reach out. There's a link for that also. You can find it from here to be added to that.

**Severin:** For people that are new to the OpenTelemetry project, a new Slack channel that we called OpenTelemetry New Contributors. If you want to start contributing, go over there and you can get started or can ask your questions and say, "Hey, I picked up that issue and I need some help with that," or "Hey, I want to help with documentation. I want to help as the collector. Can somebody guide me with that?" I think that's a really great opportunity to get started.

**Severin:** Another call to action: we started the community awards last year and we wanted to redo this once again. At KubeCon, we will call out a few members of the community where the community thinks they deserve an award. Everybody is allowed to nominate someone and this does not only include people contributing to the project. This also includes people that are promoting the project in any way. Let's say you have a person in your company that's running around and convincing everybody to use OpenTelemetry. You can nominate them. If you find four or five friends in your company and say, "Hey, let's nominate that person. Let's add them to that list." Perfectly fine with us. We want to hear those stories. 

**Severin:** Speaking about KubeCon, right? The observatory is back to KubeCon. If you want to speak, I will be first time for me at KubeCon North America this year by the way. If you want to catch up with us, you will find us there. I think we also have some schedule and program planned. You can probably tell more than I can do on that, but I'm very excited about that.

**Adriana:** If I may interject really quickly on a couple of things, I wanted to dig in quickly to the GC elections. That's pretty much open to anyone, right? I know you said it's happening next week, but anyone who's been involved in OpenTelemetry can nominate themselves for the GC elections.

**Severin:** Sorry, can you now? I lost you for a minute.

**Adriana:** Oh, anyone can nominate themselves for the GC elections that's been working in OpenTelemetry. Is that correct?

**Severin:** Yeah, but I think the nomination is closed since... 

**Adriana:** Okay. Okay.

**Severin:** Yeah. 

**Adriana:** I think you even have to be like... 

**Severin:** Yeah, everybody can be nominated. I think you need two supporters and then you're in. I said it's closed for this year, but next year we will do this once again. Maybe it would be good for anyone who's interested in running next year to just give them a heads up of what the process might be like.

### [00:05:00] Guest introduction: Severin

**Severin:** Sure. What we normally do is we will send out a blog post, I think end of September, early October, where we say, "Hey, elections are coming up. If you want to run as a candidate, create a pull request against the community repository and have two people supporting you or saying, 'Yeah, I think that person is a good candidate.'" I can recommend that if you want to do that for the first time, wait for the first people to submit their nominations or self-nomination. Let's be honest, most people self-nominate, and there's nothing wrong with that. I do that. Just use that as a template and think about if you would be elected in the governance committee of OpenTelemetry, which is responsible for managing the whole project, for the health of the project, for the community as a whole, what are the things that you would do for the project?

**Adriana:** The GC is less about, "Oh, I want the collector to do x, y, and z," or "I want to have added some specific language to the OpenTelemetry project." Of course, from a GC perspective, you can engage in those conversations with those communities, but the GC is much more about how can we grow and make our community stronger and better, and how can we manage the project as a whole so that means how can we get projects added to what we are doing, how can we make sure that they're sustainable, how can we make sure that our project is thriving.

**Severin:** Next year, around the same time window, if you want to run, that's where you should take a look.

**Adriana:** There you go. For anyone who's planning for next year, keep an eye on the nominees this year. See what, like you said, see what they've written for their nominations to get an idea of what gets you elected.

**Severin:** You're on the GC, right?

**Adriana:** Yeah.

**Severin:** What gets you elected? I think it's that you show that interest in the community. At the end of the day, it's also like...

**Adriana:** It's very hard to say that since I'm a member of the GC myself, so what I look for, but before I was a member of the GC, I always looked at what have those people done before that. Sure, putting on your nomination is one thing, like writing down, "Here's the things I want to do for the community," is one thing, but it's more about what have you done in the last few months to help people with that.

**Adriana:** From a voter perspective, it definitely helps if you've been visible in the community. It could be in a number of ways, right? Code contributions, talks, blog posts, being active in the channels, answering questions.

**Severin:** That's maybe a very important point, right? You don't have to be part of the GC to do that. We need a lot of people to do a lot of work outside of writing all the code, outside of writing all the documentation. There are so many great things you can contribute to this project. I say it very often to people that want to break into the OpenTelemetry community or any open-source community. You have skills already. You could be a good marketer or designer or technical writer or a good developer, and think about the things that you bring to the table. That's helping you to be appreciated in the community. Don't think, "Oh, I have to be a good Go programmer to be valuable to the OpenTelemetry community." That's just not true.

**Bree:** That's a great point. Before we transition over to Marilia, you still had one more thing that you wanted to show us really quickly. I think you're going to show OpenTelemetry Unplugged.

### [00:22:40] Introduction of declarative configuration format

**Severin:** Yeah, I have this slide and another one. I'm not sure how we are doing on timing. I'm talking a little bit long now. I still have one more. Let's see that we can get through that. I think people are more excited about the declarative configuration part, but people should be very excited about OpenTelemetry Unplugged. This is like an unconference we're planning for happening after FOSDEM next year. So, Monday after FOSDEM, if you're still around, register for this event and you can meet with the OpenTelemetry community. There's a blog post on that. I'm very excited about that one. 

**Severin:** Last but not least, because people are asking about that, graduation is in progress. I can share a little bit more in the tech overview. This was the text I wanted to show first, right? There are so many updates. I will not touch into anything and everything that the hotel project is doing right now. This is almost impossible. But I picked things that showed up recently. Since I saw this question coming up very early on when we started this session today is like how can I stay updated? The OpenTelemetry blog is a really good place, and we try to motivate also SIGs to put things there. For example, the profiling SIG will come out very soon with like, "Hey, we are moving towards alpha." I think that's a really great thing that we're seeing in the community. 

**Severin:** We had a blog post just recently about sampling that they're going to adopt the W3C trace context level two. That's probably worth another What's New in Hotel. I try to do like a two-sentence summary of that. It's very difficult, but in a long story to make a long story short, it's about randomness and trace ID to ensure that there's enough randomness and the trace ID, and that allows you to do certain things in sampling. I can, if we have time in the Q&A, I can try to dive into that for a little bit.

**Severin:** The mainframe community has been doing a survey just recently. I don't know if people know that we have a mainframe community with OpenTelemetry, and they just asked a bunch of questions to people on the mainframe like, "Do you know about OpenTelemetry? How do you want to see it used?" They were talking about like we need good Python and Java support, and we need to see that the OpenTelemetry collector is able to take metrics out of a mainframe. Of course, the question about what to do in COBOL. I have no more details into that, but it's a very exciting community. Even the mainframe, which is a technology for how many years around, probably longer than I'm living, and they're looking into OpenTelemetry just to close this gap for end-to-end visibility.

**Severin:** Declarative configuration, I just have it here for completeness. Looking forward to hearing about this more myself. Then we have next Android road to stable. They're working towards a version 1.0. They have done a ton of work over the last few months. Also very excited about that one. There's even a demo app now in the hotel demo, so you can even play around with that. I think that's a really good starting point into that, and they're looking for feedback, right? Go to the OpenTelemetry website, go to the OpenTelemetry blog. In that blog, there's a link to like, "Hey, what do you want the OpenTelemetry Android community doing for their next release?"

**Severin:** What I said about like we are working towards graduation, we met with the TOC of CNCF. There were a few adopter interviews. We were discussing what are the things to go next. There’s an issue on the CNCF TOC repository, it's number 1739, you can look this up. There's a summary of what are the next steps. One big thing, and this is maybe exciting because this is not new feedback for us, is that people are looking for how we can improve stability, how we can communicate stability better, and how we can look into ease of use, how we can make it easier for people to get started with OpenTelemetry. This slide alone would have covered another 20 to 25 minutes if I would have talked about browser phase one, the bail donation, which is now called OBI, the injector weaver OpenTelemetry Arrow, and there are a lot of good changes in SIGCOM. 

**Severin:** I tried to start with that, and I really hope we do those kinds of sessions more regularly so people can stay on top of things. This is how you say like scratching the surface, and then let's dig deeper next time. I hope it's helping.

**Adriana:** This was amazing.

**Severin:** Sorry, go ahead.

**Adriana:** I know. I was going to say thank you so much. That was really helpful for me.

**Severin:** Yeah, definitely. I was going to say this proves that we need more of these.

**Adriana:** Yeah. No, I mean I was learning a bunch of things while preparing. I was like, "Hey, let me ask around and talk to people like what should what's going on in your SIG? What's happening?" Our project is growing and we are adding so many cool things to it. I'm very excited about a lot of those things. Again, I can only recommend two things: go to the OpenTelemetry blog from time to time. We have those kinds of announcements there. If you're a maintainer or contributor, come to SIGCOMs and let us know about the latest and greatest of your SIG so we can share this with the wider world.

**Bree:** If Severin covered a lot, if you have any questions, please put them in the chat of whichever platform you're tuning in from, and we will get to them after we speak with our next guest. Thank you so much, Severin.

**Severin:** Yeah, thank you. Speak to you in a minute.

**Bree:** Thank you. We are getting ready now to bring on Marilia Gutierrez to talk about... What is she talking about? Bree, remind me.

**Adriana:** Amazing. Hi Marilia.

**Marilia:** Hello everyone. Continuing on the theme of where you're tuning from, I'm also tuning from Toronto. So yeah, me and Adriana.

**Adriana:** We're both Brazilians tuning in from Toronto, which is a coincidence.

**Marilia:** Small subset. That's awesome. So Marilia does a lot in the community. Would you like to share some of the work that you do before you get into declarative configuration?

**Marilia:** Yes, of course. That is one thing that I was even talking to colleagues yesterday that I keep finding more things in hotel and I just try to get involved and I just keep spreading the things that I work on. For example, I am a maintainer for the contributor experience. If you want to be a contributor and you're having some challenges, that would be the group that will help you with. I am an approver for the JavaScript SDK, for Portuguese localization, database semantic conventions, and as of a couple of days ago, also for the communications SIG as well.

**Adriana:** Yay. Amazing.

**Bree:** Dang, that is so productive.

**Marilia:** Thank you.

**Adriana:** Seriously.

**Marilia:** Even for this one, we were like, okay, we need to pick one topic to go into deep. There are so many things. Okay, I was working on this. I'm working on that. Let's pick one. I feel like the declarative config is something that is really cool that is getting to a very almost stable place, and we're going to see this implementation in several SDKs now. I think it's a really cool one to talk about.

### [00:30:56] Guest introduction: Marilia

**Bree:** Cool. So yeah, let's start. Before I start with the config, I feel like I should give a little context: what is this? Why do we need this? What are you talking about? How would you set up your SDK? You're using hotel and you want to set up some specific things for your case. Things like even my server's name or what is going to be my tracer exporter. How it was done up until now is basically using environment variables. It was very easy to do this because environment variables are universally available in all languages. It doesn't matter the SDK; there was some way to do this. 

**Marilia:** But then more complex things came up, and like, "Oh, I need this." We just published a blog post yesterday talking about the story of the declarative config. There was an issue created five years ago on the Java SIG like, "I just want to be able to filter out health checks traces. I don't want to keep sending this." There was no easy way to just filter that specific one. I have my sampler, but how do I pass what is the thing that I want to filter? That started to get very complex to do just with an environment variable, so we needed something more robust. That is the idea that came for, "Let's work on the declarative config." 

### [00:32:52] Discussion on declarative configuration implementation

**Marilia:** At this point, we now disallowed environment variables just so we don't keep adding more when we have to transition, and then we started with now declaring config. This is pretty much a YAML file, and you can just put all the things that you care about in that one. It is a little more robust compared to environment variables. It's easier to expand because you can have all the objects and types that you need there. This was a project, of course, I'm the one talking about it today, but there were several people working on this for several months, and now we're just in the phase of really implementing it in several SDKs. 

**Marilia:** The process of creating the convention is its own repo specific for this one. It takes a lot of time to get feedback from people and see what's going to work with all the languages. People have concerns like, "I'm not going to use environment variables anymore, but I'm used to them." You can still have environment variables in your config file. I can put an example here: how do you use this? If I have this, use it; otherwise, use this other thing. To just start using it, which is available today in Java and also starting in JavaScript, I do recognize the irony that you have to set up the environment variable config file to use the config file. I do see the irony in that. 

**Marilia:** Let's say, "Don't use my environment variables, use the file." But that's how you do it. The SDKs will be able to just use your config file instead of you having to set up all the environments. If you're curious, this is how a basic one looks like. Here you see the YAML. We have some resources. Here we have an example that still points to an environment variable if you care. I have some examples like tracer provider. I only care about the endpoints. This is all anything that I put in here. 

**Marilia:** The example that I mentioned for the issue that was created: "I just want to filter my health checks." This is an example of how you do this. Java is already working, and you can see here just like a sampler, and I say, "My rule, I want to drop if I have these attributes with this pattern." It's a lot easier than having to go into the code or your instrumentation trying to create your sampler or trying to have this environment somehow. Now you just create this object, and that's it. You don't have to care about how the SDK would do this. 

**Marilia:** Of course, it has a lot of things. I'm just trying to put a few screenshots. This can be quite big. You can see here like, "Oh, I have a processor. I have a batch with this schedule with this timeout. My exporter is this type." We have a file called kitchen sink on that repo that every single spec that is created is added to this file, which is the one that I'm showing here. If you want to see examples of everything you have here, it has comments of what it means, what are the values, what are like the default values if you don't put them. It's a great one, and we also have one for migration. If you're like, "I just want the basic because I'm using my environment variables and I don't want to have to copy," you just copy that file, and it's still going to use your environment variables for some basic stuff.

**Marilia:** If you want to know what is available today, we have this matrix of compliance: Java is fully compliant; PHP, JavaScript is partially compliant. We do have a lot of other languages that are also working on it. I think we just need to update this for a few of them, like for example Go and Python are also having some implementation. When I say it's fully compliant, it does not mean that it's ended; that is not what it means. There are still features that still need to be added, but at least the basic of what you're seeing here is working for those languages. 

**Marilia:** Here I can probably copy this in the chat and we can share, but I put it a few links for resources: the blog post that I mentioned, which is in English and in Portuguese. That is one of the cool things about localization that I already created, like both of them. I have the file, the repo for the configuration, and the examples that I mentioned: the kitchen sink, the migration itself, and if you have questions about the config file in general, you can use the Slack channel, so the hotel config file if you want to have specifics for the SDK. For example, how this is working on the Java one or the JavaScript one. 

**Bree:** That's awesome. 

**Marilia:** Yeah, that's what I have for an overview for today.

**Bree:** I had a follow-up question for you, Marilia. These configurations, it sounds like they are language-dependent. So you do them at the language level, not at the collector level. Is that correct?

**Marilia:** So one thing is supposed to be completely agnostic. So you can use the same file; it doesn't matter which SDK you're using. There are parts that are also for the collector. For example, the collector is already using the declarative config for a couple of things.

**Bree:** Right.

**Marilia:** It's pretty much already added there. I don't have a list with me easily to just show what are the things that are working, but the idea is to have all components able to have the declarative config. It’s just a matter of now we need to go and implement it in all those places.

**Bree:** How does the config file get loaded up? Does it get loaded as part of...?

**Marilia:** Are you talking specifically about the collector or in general?

**Bree:** Oh, no, just the declarative config, like for the environment variables.

**Marilia:** For example, I can talk about the JavaScript, which is the one that I'm working on. When you initialize the SDK, usually you do like, for example, new SDK, and sometimes you have to pass parameters. This time, you're not going to need to do this. Your file is going to exist in the same place that you're adding your instrumentation.

**Bree:** Does it pick it up from... as long as you have that file in a particular directory in your code, it'll pick it up. Is that the idea?

**Marilia:** Yeah, because the environment variable points to the file. As long as you put this is the path to the file. When you initialize the SDK, it's going to check like, "Do you have a config file?" If you don't, it's going to ignore and use whatever you were doing before. But if it has, it's going to say, "Okay, let me check what you have on that file." For some things, it's pretty much saying, "If you have this value, I'm going to use it, otherwise it has default values for a lot of things." It's basically that. The moment when you initialize the SDK, that's when it's going to read and do whatever it needs to do.

**Bree:** Okay. That makes a lot of sense. This is cool because I guess it also lets you... I guess if you're using just the old way of just the environment variables, that was very flat, right? This kind of gives it a little bit more structure too. It lets you lump configurations together, which is very cool.

**Marilia:** Yeah, because we have a section for everybody. It's supposed to be very agnostic. Now my application is in Python; I can use the same. But of course, there are things that are very specific to languages, like agents only exist in Java. But, oh, I still want to configure this. The config file has sections for languages as well. If you have, like, this is specific for Java, do this. We have those types of things there as well.

**Bree:** That's awesome. Ree, do you have anything that you wanted to chime in on? I'm still processing.

**Ree:** It's so cool, right? My mind is blown. I'm like, where were you like five years ago?

**Marilia:** Yeah. The idea is even that for some of the things, you don't have to restart some of the components, and can just read as is. That is also an advantage as well.

**Bree:** I think we can get right into some Q&A because I do have questions, and I think our audience has some questions. So Lisa, we would love to bring you on.

**Lisa:** Hi, Lisa. 

### [00:41:56] Audience Q&A session begins

**Lisa:** All right, thank you so much. Hello everybody. I'm Lisa Jung, a staff developer advocate at Grafana Labs. I'm part of the communications and the end-user SIG. Now we are gathering questions from the audience and asking our lovely feature speakers here. The first question is from Cecil. He said if you have both options, environment variables or the configuration in a project, which one takes precedence?

**Marilia:** If you do have the environment variable saying, "This is my config file," that is the one that takes precedence, and it's going to use this. It's not going to use the environment variable as a backup at all. It's going to ignore that unless you have your config file that has the environment variable on that file. But that takes precedence.

**Lisa:** Gotcha. Thank you. Then we have a question from Kieran. "Rust is still a four-letter word. Long way to go?" 

**Marilia:** For the declarative config, I believe this question came up during your...

**Marilia:** It is hard sometimes for the SIGs to handle because they have to review PRs that come in and do releases. It's hard sometimes to keep up with everything that's going on. The same thing like database conventions came out. A lot of SDKs still don't have implementation. If you really care about REST, that is your chance to join the SIG and actually be a contributor. People are always happy to help and have people joining in. You can say, "This is something that I'm interested in, and I really care about how do I start contributing?" It's a way for you to be able to have things happen faster because your contribution is going to have a lot of weight if there are not a lot of people helping out. 

**Lisa:** Gotcha. All right. We have a question for Severin. What does W3C trace context L2 for tail sampling bring to the table?

**Severin:** Yeah, I said I had to take some notes on that myself because it's a very complex topic, and I'm also not a sampling expert, but I try my very best. We've been doing sampling in OpenTelemetry for I think over four years now, and it has been evolving. We've added a lot of good things. One of the things that we had is this trace ID ratio-based sampler. This sampler always had this to-do where we said, "Hey, all you can do safely with that is sampling on root spans." You had not a lot of good guarantees on probability downstream. 

**Severin:** The big problem is that in the trace ID until level two, there were no guarantees on how many of those bits are truly random or are maybe encoding some additional information. This is what has been changed in that new standard and OpenTelemetry is adopting that. You send an additional flag when you use that, and with that, you get 56 bits of sufficient randomness, and you can use that. Again, this is me just talking from a few notes that I took from the blog post. I can highly recommend reading into that. If we talk about sampling, we all know that with the amount of data that people are consuming these days with OpenTelemetry, this is urgently needed, and they need a lot of good hands to also try out those things. 

**Lisa:** Gotcha. To piggyback on that, Henrik, what about consistent probabilistic sampling?

**Severin:** I'm not exactly sure, so that's maybe a good thing for the next round, right? Maybe invite someone from the sampling SIG and have them talk about that specifically, right? It looks like there's some interest in that.

**Lisa:** Yeah, absolutely. So Marilia, Fernando has a question for you. Can I have more than one config file, like a file with generated configs or another with only specific JavaScript configs?

**Marilia:** The file itself is going to be one because otherwise we don't know which one takes precedence. For example, if the part that I mentioned that are specific to language is still part of the same file. If you have something that you want to have different for different applications, you need one file for each one. This is something like, for example, that you can take advantage of some things related to environment variables. Imagine that you have the exact same thing, but I want to have the service name different on those two. What you do then, your config file points just to say like, "Use the environment variable for this case," and then you have your two environments that use the different name.

**Lisa:** Gotcha. Another question from Henrik for Marilia. Would the OTL operator provide a config CRD that could be deployed across Kubernetes objects?

**Marilia:** Not sure because I don't see a reason to add new config. The idea is to have all possible config that we want to exist in that file. It's just a matter of getting feedback from the community because we have something a little more stable and say like, "What is missing and what we can add there?" Those are the points that we need feedback from people. I can check this one specifically, but from the top of my mind, I don't know the answer if we have something already for this one.

**Lisa:** Gotcha. We have a question from Cecil, so please feel free to jump in, Severin or Marilia. Is there any guidance you can share around OpenTelemetry for long-running background processes?

**Severin:** Yeah, I can pick that. This is actually a very complicated topic, right? I just looked it up. There's an issue on the OpenTelemetry specification from 2019 since the project was founded by Armen around that topic. The very first guidance I can give is go to that issue, to that repository, and call out that you're interested in that, and maybe even interested in helping with that. It's a very gnarly topic. 

**Severin:** What can you do until then? I mean, at the end, it depends a little bit on what does "long" mean to you. If we talk about spans and traces taking a few minutes, then we are totally fine. You should be just fine with the tracing that you're doing today. But if you say, "Hey, this is the classic thing," you have a background job, and maybe this is doing some video encoding, and maybe you want to do something around that. One thing you definitely can do today, right, is use logging and events for that and maybe announce those kinds of things and say, "Okay, now I'm starting, now I'm ending." It’s not perfect, and let's be super honest with that, and there are probably still things you need to do on your back end. You have to work around that and just let us know that we need to do more on that topic.

**Lisa:** Thanks, everyone. As we wrap up our Q&A, I'm going to ask one question to both Severin and Marilia. You've been contributing to hotel for a long time. I'm going to take you all the way to the beginning. How did you get your start in contributing to hotel? Do you have any advice for new contributors?

**Marilia:** Who goes first? You want to start, or should I start?

**Severin:** You can start.

**Marilia:** Yeah. My reason to start with OpenTelemetry was a very selfish reason. This is something I always tell people: if you want to get into open source, have your own good reason to start with open source. 

**Severin:** Have something where you say, "I don't know; I want sampling to be better in OpenTelemetry because I have way too much telemetry, so let me get started with sampling and then make this thing work." 

**Marilia:** My situation back then was like I was in a consulting position, and I was talking with a lot of people about what we back then called APM. We were still transitioning to call everything observability. People had questions about OpenTelemetry. They told me like, "Hey, what is this thing? Should I use that or should I stick with this thing I have already?" This was something where I recognized, "Hey, I have to level up on that." 

**Marilia:** I went to the community and said, "Let me get started on that. Let me learn myself what this OpenTelemetry thing is so that I can speak better to my users, to our customers, to people that want to get into our product." I started to help with documentation, help us getting started. I started actually also in the JavaScript community, but then I stuck with documentation because again, this was the most helpful thing for myself to just explain OpenTelemetry better to other people. 

**Severin:** For me, it was basically I had been working on observability at a few companies before, and I was like, "Oh, I like this observability thing, and I want to focus on that." I was looking for a job that basically is my job. I only have to think about the observability, and this is why I went to Grafana, that the team was like, "You have to contribute to hotel." That was exactly what I wanted. 

**Severin:** I do actually have, I was going to say, we just created a post that I can share here. There are ideas on how to contribute because if you wanted again, you can have several reasons for it, or you're just working on something because your company needs or something your own personal project needs, and you want to develop something you just want to learn. You want to increase your network. Pick something that really interests you like, "I already have knowledge and I want to focus on that," or something like, "I'm just curious about this thing I don't know, but I want to learn." You can have both ways and really dig deep into those ones. OpenTelemetry is a huge project with so many components and languages. You will find it; it's just a matter of finding what is your place there, and you can try it out. There is no thing like, "I picked this. Now I have to go through this one until the end." No, join a couple of calls, just listen in. You don't have to say anything like, "Oh, this thing seems interesting." Continue a little more; if no, this is not for me, go to the next one until you find what is the thing that really excites you.

**Lisa:** Nice. Thanks, Marilia. Severin, Adriana, and Bree have been amazing guides and mentors when I was first getting started with OpenTelemetry.

**Lisa:** Now, there's one more burning question for both of you. The question is, what kind of interesting usage trends in terms of implementation, observability stack, docs page views, or anything have you seen over the past year?

**Marilia:** I think this is more of like whatever people did not think was necessarily important before to have observability on. They're like, "Oh yeah, that would be good if I actually know what the hell was going on." You're going to find a little of everything. People are really now until mobile, like nobody was paying attention or the browser one that's been really active. It's just like what we forgot to add it, okay, let's work on all this thing because it's really important. So it's just like all over. You're going to find from every single place, and even things that people do for fun, like I want to monitor the quality of the air and humidity on my plants. There are people that do this to say, "Oh no, I'm actually working at NASA and want to know what's going on."

### [00:58:08] Audience question on long-running background processes

**Severin:** I can try to make it quick because there are so many things I could now answer that I was just thinking about it. I had five or ten things in my head, but let me pick a few. One thing is, and this may be close to like, "Hey, let's measure the humidity in our room." I saw more and more databases being used. Observability is inside the database. I know that now people are thinking, "Why not do tracing inside the database?" It’s something I find very funny. Similar to what I mentioned before, right? Your Docker build. 

**Severin:** You can put OpenTelemetry into just everything and get amazing data. The other thing, and then I tried to make it quick so we can get to an end, is I think people start to recognize that with OTLP, they can send their data everywhere. I mean, Adriana, you wrote about that. Don't send your traces, logs, and metrics into different places. That's not what I'm talking about. It's more like, "Wait a minute, I can send a bunch of my data over into that back end, and I can send maybe another portion of that data into another specific tool." 

**Severin:** People are starting to recognize they have a lot of freedom with the data, right? They have a lot of freedom with the observability data beyond what observability vendors offer today or what we do with trace explorers, alerting, and all the capabilities that we had before. This is actually a topic I'm very curious and excited about right now that we say, "Wait a minute, now we have all this data. What else can we do with that?" I think that's super, super interesting.

### [01:00:04] Closing remarks and future events

**Lisa:** Thank you. It has been really interesting, and thank you all so much for following along. If you have additional questions, please find us on CNCF Slack instance at hotel-sig-end-user channel. There is a QR code on the screen for you to use. Huge shout out to Henrik Rexet, who is doing all this live streaming stuff for us on the back end. Thank you so much to Lisa for hosting our Q&A, to Adriana for being my co-host, and Severin and Marilia for taking the time to come on and keep us updated. Thank you so much.

**Severin:** Thank you for having us.

**Marilia:** Happy to be here.

**Lisa:** We got a question asking when the next one is. This means that I guess we'll have to put on another one. We definitely plan on putting on another one, hoping for a monthly cadence. But we also have KubeCon coming up in November, so we'll see. Speaking of KubeCon, as Severin mentioned, the Hotel Observatory is happening. If you haven't been to the Hotel Observatory booth, it's loads of fun. This is where all the cool hotel peeps come to hang out. 

**Lisa:** We're also doing a live stream from KubeCon, and I guess we'll call it the Humans of Hotel live stream. I guess it will be, to a certain extent, a What's New in Hotel. Keep an eye out for that. I believe it's happening on the Wednesday, November 12th, starting at 2:30 PM Eastern time. 

**Lisa:** I think that's it. Do you have anything else, Bree, to add to that?

**Bree:** No, thank you all for being here.

**Severin:** Yeah, thank you. 

**Marilia:** If you have a cool OpenTelemetry story to share, whether it's like how you use OpenTelemetry in your organization or you have a presentation that you want to do about cool stuff you've done with OpenTelemetry, reach out to us in the hotel and user SIG again. It's hotel-sig-end-user on Slack. We would love to hear from you.

**Lisa:** Yes. Thank you so much, everyone. We'll see you next time.

**All:** Thank you, everyone. Bye.

## Raw YouTube Transcript

Heat. Heat. Hello. >> Hello everyone. Welcome. >> Welcome. Uh, if you're on Pacific time like me, it's early 800 am. Still dark. >> And thank you for joining if you're on Pacific time. >> You're welcome. >> Well, hi. Welcome to this special edition of Open Telemetry and User Sig Live. We're very excited to bring to you a brand new segment called What's New in Hotel. I am Bree Lee. I'm a senior developer relations engineer at New Relic. Um, and I get to work with the lovely Adriana Villa. Would you like to introduce yourself? >> Yes. Uh, yeah. My name is Adriana Vila. I work with Ree in the hotel and user SIG and I am a principal developer advocate at Dino Trace. And like Reese said, this is our very first what's new in hotel. And I think this is really exciting because um I don't know about you, but for me I I can never keep up with all the stuff that's going on in hotel. So I kind of need someone to tell me. So this is a little selfserving and we're we're we're basically bringing folks in from the hotel community to tell us some of the cool stuff that is going on. >> Yes. And hello, Michael. >> Hi. Yay. Thanks for joining us. I know it's it's lateish for you. >> It's way 5 5:00 pm for you. So, thank you for joining, Michael. >> Yes. And by the way, um I am coming in from Portland, Oregon. And if you would like to share where you're tuning in from uh in the chat of whichever app you're using, we would love to see where you're from because there's a pretty good >> there's a pretty good variety of time zones on this call as well. So it so for example, Adriana is coming from Toronto. >> That's right. Yeah. And you said it right. You said Toronto, not Toronto. >> Amazing. Yes, I'm I'm from Canada, so uh rep representing um yeah. Um so I guess this is uh a good time to bring in our first guest. >> Oh yeah, sorry. Sorry. Yes. >> So yes, so just to give you all um a sneak peek into what um our new segment is going to look like. Um, we are gonna speak with Severn Newman. And then we're gonna speak with Marilia Gutierrez. And finally, we are gonna bring on Lisa Young to Lisa Jung. I don't know why I said young. Um, and she's going to host our audience Q&A um, at the very end. So, if you have questions, um, put them in the chat and we will get to them um, at the end of both of the first two interviews during the audience Q&A. Hopefully that'll make sense. Um, and yes, like Adriana said, let's bring on Severign. Oh, Egypt is also watching. >> Hey, >> happy to be here. >> Thanks for joining us. >> Yeah, sure. >> Where are you? Um, where are you coming to us live from? >> Yeah, I'm based in Germany. Uh, so I'm close to Nuremberg. So, yeah, central European time. >> So, it's it's evening for you. So definitely. >> Yeah, it's 500 p.m. So it's it's getting dark again. So summer is officially over >> unfortunately. >> And and then next week you guys get the time change of 1 hour back and then North America gets the time change of 1 hour >> back this week because like it's like screwing up my whole calendar. So it's like oh everything is now at 5:00 p.m. which should be at 6 p.m. and everything. So yeah, le let's get over it with it. So >> yeah. Well, at least we have like one one more week of not have having to worry about that. So, >> yeah. Yeah. >> Um, so do you want to introduce yourself briefly? >> Yeah, sure. So, >> all things >> Sorry. >> Tell us all the things you do for hotel. >> Right. Thank you so much. >> I I try my best. Yeah. So, I'm uh Se No, uh, however you pronounce it, I I always also pronounce it differently when I speak English or German. Um I'm head of community and developer relations at Cosley. Um and I'm part of the open telemetry governance committee and I'm also one of the co-maintainers of what we call sikcoms. So what we do is the website, the blog, uh the social media channels and like everything around that. So so that's uh that's a very short version of of what I do for the open telemetry community. Yeah. and I'm super excited to be here today to give you a a first start into what's new in open telemetry. Um, so yeah, that's me. >> Amazing. So I guess uh let's let's get started then. Uh do you have some goodies that you can share with us? >> Yeah, absolutely. So I have prepared a little bit of slides not to like bore everybody out with like a lot of tax and more like to make a few of these things I wanted to share with you a little bit more visual. So I have three topics to talk about right a little bit hotel and numbers because I'm always excited about seeing how big this project has grown um and then a little bit about the community and then a little bit about uh the tech stuff. I think that's the stuff uh the things that most people are excited about. So yeah, let me share my screen and get started with a little bit on the numbers. Um, yeah. Uh, so those numbers are like for all the time, right? So since open telemetry was created what is it now 6 years ago we had almost 20,000 contributors from 120 countries and like I call it organizations but think about it's like companies and and yeah foundations whatever like almost 2,000 organizations. Uh I also looked up the numbers for the last 12 months which is still like 6,000 contributors over 70 countries over 600 organizations. So you see like there's a lot of velocity in in in our project, right? So um and and then this is like growing and growing every year and we see it also like with the PRs and and and and like the the work that's happening on GitHub. I mean we have to add here right something like this session here is not recorded by anything that you see on CNCF Devstat, right? There's a lot of work going on in our community that's not tracked on those boards unfortunately. Uh so also big shout out to everybody doing let's say the work outside of the repositories but I still think like those numbers are impressive right in since foundation of the project we had like those 60,000 APRs uh reviewed as you can see like most of them three to four times and then like over half a million comments right so that means like uh there were over half million times someone wrote something on a below our issue or pull request or something like that which I think is really great and Like what's what's really exciting is like uh in the last year I think 20% of those PRs have been just done in the last year which is like huge growth and especially like from the reviews 30 30% of them have been done in the last year meaning like we're leveling up our reviews right so so we have more and more repositories where we say like hey you're not done with one review you maybe need two reviews or for example in our open telemetry IO repository, we need a review from docs maintainers and from like the co-owners sig and and I think this this really helps with the quality of the project. Um, and who's doing that, right? So, and and this is some number I'm I'm super happy to be able to share because we build a a page for that specifically on the open telemetry website where we list all the triagers, all the approvers and all the maintainers. Um and as you can see like those are like people that stepped up and and took over a role where they said like hey I help us triaging I help us like managing the repositories I help with running the sik meetings and and if you do the math there's like almost 300 people just having those kinds of roles which is I think really really great to have. So yeah, a big shout out to everybody who's who's helping with that and also a big shout out to all the people I'm not listing here because there's so many people in our community that that are helping or that they're that just landing in our community and then wanting to to step up and and do much more things. Um yeah, and then of course who is using open telemetry, right? And um there's always like three kind of groups that we mention. Um there's first of all of course like what we call the vendors or like the backends. So this is of course companies that consume open telemetry data and do something with it. Uh but also open source projects, right? This also includes Jagger or open search. Um but then there's also what we call integrations, right? Um and that number is probably much much bigger. So this is just what we have on our website. Um those are projects that said like hey we add open telemetry to our project natively. So things like uh Kubernetes has their API server supporting open telemetry or uh there's the PHP server called roadrunner runner that has open telemetry. I always love mentioning that one because like it's written in Go and then doing PHP. So you can even do tracing from Go into the PHP in this web server. This is this is really something I always love seeing. Oh and also Docker, right? So if you I think it's Docker Buildkit and Docker another project of Docker like you can see your containers being built with open telemetry. I think that's also very fun. Um and then of course thousands of adopters right I I I mean every time I'm in a presentation or in a room and I ask people like hey who of you knows about open telemetry most of their hands go up and then if I say like hey and who of you is using open telemetry also like 80% of the people are raising their hand. Unfortunately, this is something we don't have that many listed on our website. So, here's the the first call to action. If you are an open telemetry adopter, if you have uh maybe even written a blog from your company where you say like, hey, here's how we use open telemetry. Here's how it's helping us. Um just use that link um and you can reach out and and and we can have you add it there, right? Um so, yeah, that's a little bit open telemetry numbers. Um, I think that's just a good starting point and let's talk about the community or is there anything you you'd like to deep dive on that slide? I think it's just good to get started. >> Yeah, I think uh I I think let's dive into let's dive into the next topic. >> Yeah. Awesome. I think that's that's now more exciting. Right. As I said, I always love to start with those numbers to just emphasize how how big this community has grown. And that also means like there's a lot of community updates and especially like we all know CubeCon is coming and for whatever reasons September, October, November is like all those community changes that are going on. Um, and one I'd like to highlight because like I'm one of the maintainers of this project is like if you go to the Open Telemetry.io website. There's now nine languages that we have started to translate the open tele telemetry website to. So that includes English just like the base language. But then we have Bengali, Spanish, French, Japanese, Portuguese, Romanian, Ukrainian and Chinese. I I have written it down so so that I don't forget anybody. But I think that's amazing, right? I mean we have like started with that a little bit more than a year ago with four languages and it has grown to nine languages. And this is really amazing community because I think that's a really great way to get started with open telemetry, right? So you can translate the things into your native language, learn about them and then maybe move into different projects of the open telemetry project with with this additional understanding. Um yeah, then maybe a big call out the technical committee has uh added two members. So David Ashpole and Josh McDonald have joined the TC. David is uh like subject matter expert on metrics Prometheus. He's in Kubernetes contributor as well. Um and Josh has stepped down from the TC a while ago is now coming back in and he's like in the sampling sig. He is one of the people behind the hotel arrow and so many other things. So so I'm I'm probably not doing him justice only only calling out those two things. Uh but yeah big congrat congratulations to the two for for joining the TC and we will see the the impact they will have on on the project very soon. Um then another one the governance committee election is coming up uh next week. So we just announced the the candidates if you are member of standing how we call it in the open telemetry community you should have uh a notification about you being allowed to elect. If you think that you're allowed to be uh in in that election as a as a voter and have not get let's say your your access to that, reach out. There's a link for that also. You you can find it from here um to to be added to that. Um there for for people that are new to the open telemetry project, a new slack channel that we called open telemetry new contributors. So if you want to start contributing go over there um and you can get started or can ask your questions and say like hey I picked up that issue and I need some help with that or hey I want to help with documentation I want to help as the collector can somebody guide me with that. So I think that's a really great opportunity to get started. Um yeah another call to action I think I have a few more coming. So so so take down your your paper and and and take some notes. We we have community awards, right? So, we started with this last year and we wanted to redo this once again. So, at CubeCon, uh we will call out a few members of the community where the community thinks like they deserve an award, right? So, so everybody is allowed to nominate someone and this also does not only include like people contributing to the project. This also includes people that are promoting the project in any way, right? So let's say you have a person in your company that's running around and convincing everybody to use open telemetry. Uh you can nominate them, right? If you find four or five friends in your company and say like, "Hey, let's nominate that person. Let's let's add them to that list." Perfectly fine with us, right? We we want to hear those stories. We want to hear about people that are promoting open telemetry. >> Um and speaking about CubeCon, right? I mean, the observatory is back to CubeCon. Uh so if you want to speak If you if you want to speak with us at CubeCon, I will be first time for me at CubeCon North America America this year by the way. So So if you want to catch up with you, if you want to speak with us, uh you will find us there. Um I think we also have some schedule and some program there planned. Um you can probably tell more than I can do on that, but yeah, I'm very excited about that. >> Yeah. And uh if I if I may interject really quickly on on a couple of things, um >> I wanted to uh just dig in quickly to the uh on the GC elections. Um because that's that's pretty much open to anyone, right? I know you said like it's it's it's happening next week. Um but anyone who's been involved in open telemetry can um can nominate themselves right for the GC elections. >> Sorry, can you now I lost you for a minute. >> Oh uh anyone anyone uh can nominate themselves for the GC elections that's been working in open telemetry. Is that correct? Yeah, but I think the nomination is closed since like Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, so that's why I did not call that the nomination. But yeah, no, fair enough. Fair enough. >> I think I think even you have don't have to be like >> So, so yeah, everybody can be nominated. I think you need two supporters and then you're you're in. I said it's closed for this year, but next year, yeah, we will do this once again. So maybe maybe it would be good for anyone who's interested in in uh uh running next year to uh just give them a heads up heads up of what the process might be like. >> Uh yeah, sure. So um what what we what we normally do is um we will send out a blog post I think end of September, early October where we say like hey elections are coming up. Uh if you want to run as a candidate create a pull request against the community repository and have two people uh supporting you or saying like yeah I think that person is a good candidate. Um, I can recommend that like if you want to do that for the first time, wait for the first people to submit their uh their nomination or self-nomination. Let's be honest, most people self-nominate and and there's nothing wrong with that. I do that. Um and just use that as a template and then think about like if you would be elected in the governance committee of open telemetry which is like responsible for managing the whole project for the health of the project for the community as a whole what what are the things that that that you would do for the project right so so the GC just to call this out this is less about like oh I want the collector to do x y and zed or I want to to have I don't know added some specific language to the open telemetry project of course from a GC perspective let's let's say you can engage in those conversations with those communities but but the GC is much more around like how can we grow and and make our community stronger and better and how can we manage the project as a whole so that means like how can we get projects added to to what we are doing how can we make sure that they're sustainable how can we make sure um that that our project is thriving right um so yeah next year around the same time window if you want to run. Uh that that that's where where you should should take a look. >> There you go. And for anyone who's planning for next year, I guess uh keep keep an eye on the nominees this year. See what like you said, see what they've what they've written for their nominations to get a an idea of of the types of things that that gets you that gets you elected. You you're you're on the you're on the GC, right? >> Yeah. Yeah. Um so yeah I um what what gets you elected I think is like um that that you show that interest in the community right I mean at the end of the day it's also like >> very oft that's it's very hard to say that since I'm member of the the GC myself. So, so what I look for but um before I was member of the GC right and before I was like voting with this insight in perspective I always looked at like >> um what have those people done before that right sure putting on your nomination is the one thing like writing down hey here's the things I want to do for the community um is is is the one thing um but but but um yeah it's more about like what have you done in the last I don't know few months to uh to to help people with that right so so that's that's the thing yeah >> yeah and I think from a voter perspective it definitely helps if you've been visible in the community and you know and and it could be you know in a number of ways right code contributions talks um blog posts um you know being active in the channels answering questions Yeah. Yeah. And that's maybe a very important point, right? You don't have to be part of the GC to do that, right? I mean, we we we need a lot of people to do a lot of work outside of of writing all the code, outside of writing all the documentation. Um there there's so many great things you contri can contribute to this project and and I say it very often to people that that want to uh either break into the open telemetry community or in any open source community. I mean, you have skills already, right? You could be a good marketeteer person or you could be a designer or you could be a good technical writer or you could be a good developer, right? And and think about the things that you bring to the table. Um, and and that's helping you to to to be appreciated in the community, right? Don't think like, oh, I have to be a good go go go programmer to to be valuable to the open telemetry pro community. That's that's just not true. That's a great point. And and I think before we transition over to Marilia, you still had one more thing that you wanted to show us really quickly. I think you're going to show hotel unplugged. >> Yeah, I I have like the slide and another one. I'm not sure how we doing on timing. I'm talking a little bit long now. So I still have like one more. Um but let's see that we can get through that. I think people are more excited about the declarative configuration part, but people should be very excited about open telemetry unplug. This is like an an unconference we're planning for happening after FOSTM next year. So Monday after FOST day if you're still around uh register for this event and then you can like meet with the open telemetry community. There's a blog post on that. Um very excited about that one. Uh and then last but not least because people are asking about that graduation is in progress. I can share a little bit more in the in the tech overview. Um so yeah that's on the community updates. Um, let me hopefully go into the technical highlights. Um, this was the text I wanted to show first, right? There's so many updates. I will not touch into anything and everything uh that the hotel project is doing right now, right? So, so this is almost impossible. But I picked like the things that that showed up recently and since I saw this question coming up uh very early on when when we started like this um this session today is like how can I stay updated the open telemetry blog is a really good place and we try to motivate also six to to put things there for example the profiling s they will come out very soon with like hey we are moving towards alpha I think that's a that's a really great thing that that we're seeing in the community And equally, we had a blog post just recently about sampling that they're going to adopt the W3C trace context level two. Um, that's probably worth another what's new in hotel. I I try to do like a two sentence summary of that. It's very difficult but but in a long story to make a long story short it's about mainly about randomness and and trace ID to to ensure that like enough there's enough randomness and the trace ID and that allows you to do certain things and sampling. Um I can like if we have time in the Q&A I can try to to dive into that for a little bit. Um the mainframe community has been doing a a survey just recently and I don't know if if people know that like we have a mainframe community with an open telemetry and they just ask a bunch of questions to like people on the mainframe like do you know about open telemetry how how do you want to see it used and they were talking about like hey we need good Python and Java support we need to see that the open telemetry collector is is able to take uh metrics out out of a mainframe and of course the question about like what to do in cobalt. I have no more details into that but but it's a very exciting community that like hey even even the mainframe which is like a technology for how many years around um probably longer than I'm living um and they're looking into open telemetry just to close this gap for for end to- end visibility declarative configuration I just have it here for completeness looking forward to hear about this more myself um and then we have next Android road to stable. Uh so so they're working towards a version 1.0. They have done a ton of work over the last few months. So also very excited about that one. There's even an demo app now in the hotel demo with Android. So so you can even play around with that. I think that's a really good starting point into that. And they're looking for feedback, right? So So go to the open telemetry website, go to the open telemetry blog. in that blog there's a link to like hey what do you want the hotel Android community doing for for their next release um and then what I said about like we are working towards graduation we met with the TOC of CNCF there were a few adopter interviews we were like discussing what what are the things to go next so so there's a an issue on the CNCF TOC um repository it's number I I wrote it down 1739 you can look this up and there's a summary of like what are the next step right and and one big thing and and this is maybe exciting because this is not new feedback for us that like people are looking for like how can we improve stability how can we communicate stability better and how can we look into into ease of use how can we make it easier for people to get started with open telemetry right um and I said probably this slide alone would have covered like um another 20 to 25 minutes if I would have talked about browser phase one the bail donation which is now called OBI the injector weaver hotel arrow they're doing a new phase we have a call for contributors for cotlin a lot of good changes in samcom so yeah um I tried to start with that and I really hope we do those kinds of sessions more regularly so people can uh stay on top of things uh so yeah this is how you say like scratching the surface and then let's dig deeper next time. So yeah, hope it's helping. >> This was amazing. And >> Oh, sorry. Go ahead. >> I know. I was going to say thank you so much. Like that was really helpful for me. >> Yeah, definitely. I was going to say this proves that we need more of these. >> Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean I was learning a bunch of things while preparing. I was like, "Hey, let me let me ask around and let's talk with people like what should what what's going on in your sick? What what's happening?" Right? But I mean, our project is is is is growing and growing and we are adding so many cool things to it. And um yeah, I'm very excited about a lot of those things. And again, I only can recommend two things. Uh go to the open telemetry blog from time to time. We have those kinds of announcements there. And if you're a maintainer or contributor, come to uh sikcoms and and let us know about the latest and greatest of your sik so so we can share this with with the wider world. Right. >> And again, if um seven covered a lot, if you have any questions, please put them in the chat of whichever platform you're tuning in from and we will get to them um after we speak with our next guest. Thank you so much, Severin. >> Yeah, thank you. Speak to you in a minute. Thank you. And and we are getting ready now to bring on Marilia Gutieres um to talk about What is she talking about? Reese remind me. >> Amazing. Hi Marilia. >> Hello everyone. Well continue on the team of where you're tuning from. I'm also tuning from Toronto. So yeah, me and Nana. Yeah. >> And and we're both Brazilians tuning in from Toronto which is Coincidence >> small subset. That's awesome. Um, so Marilia does a lot in the community. Would you like to share some of the work that you do before you get into configur declarative configuration? >> Yes, of course. Uh, so yeah, that is one thing that I was even talking like a colleagues yesterday that I keep finding more things in hotel and I just trying to get involved and I just like keep spreading the things that I work on. So for example, I am a maintainer for the contributor experience. So if you want to be a contributor and you're having some challenges, that would be the group that will help you with. I am an approver for the JavaScript SDK for Portuguese localization uh database semantic conventions and as of a couple of days ago also for the communications s as well. >> Yay. Amazing. >> Dang, that is so productive. No, >> you're an inspiration. >> Thank you. >> Seriously. >> Yeah. So, even like for this one that we were like, okay, we need to pick one topic to go into deep like so many things like, okay, I was working on this, I'm working on that. Let's pick one. But I feel like the cratical effect is something that is really cool that is getting to a very like almost stable uh place and we're going to see this implementation several like SDKs now. Uh so I think it's a really cool one to talk about. Cool. So yeah, let's let's start. Uh so before I start with the K config, I feel like I should give a little context like what is this? Why do we need this? What are you talking about? So how you would set up like your SDK? You're like you're using hotel and you want to set up some specific things for your case. things like even like my server's name or like what is going to be my tracer exporter. So how it was done up until now is basically using environment variables and it it was very like easy to do this and because environment variables is just universally available on all languages. So it doesn't matter the SDK there was like some way to do this but then more complex things came up and like oh I need this and just we we just published a blog post yesterday talking about the story of the critical config there was an issue created five years ago on the Java CX like I just want to be able to filter out health checks traces I don't want to keep sending this there is no easy way to just like filter that specific one like I have my sampler but how do I pass what is the thing that I want to filter so that start to get very complex to do just with an environment variable so we needed something more robust so that is the idea that came for let's work on with the character config so at this point we now disallowed environment variables so just so we don't keep like adding more when we have to transition and then we started with now declaring config so this is pretty much a YAML file and you can just put all the things that you care about on that one. It is a little more robust with just compared to environment variables is easier to expand because you can have like all the objects and types that you need there. Uh and because this was a project of course I'm the one talking about it today but there were like several people that working on this for several months and now we're just on the phase of really implementing on several SDKs but the process of actually creating the convention there is this own like uh repo specific for this one it it takes a lot of time to get feedback from people and see what's going to work with all the languages And also people have concern like I'm not going to use environment variables anymore but I'm used to them. So you can still have environment variables on your config file. So I can't I put it an example here like how do you use this and like if I have this use it otherwise use this other thing and to just start using which is uh available today in Java and also starting on JavaScript is I I do recognize the irony that you have to set up the environment variable config file to use the config file. I do see the irony on that. Let's say like don't use my environment variables, use the file. I do. Yeah. But that's how you do it. And then from that means like the SDKs are will be able to just use your config file instead of having set up all the environments. So if you're curious, this is how a basic one look like. So here you see like the ammo. So we have like some resources. Here we have like an example that you still points to environment variable if you care. Uh and then I have like some example like tracer provider. I only care about the end points. So this is all anything that I put in here. And then here the the example that I mentioned for like the issue that was created like I just want to filter my health checks. This is an example how you do this uh on Java is already working. Uh and you can see here just like a sampler and I say like my rule I want to drop if I have this attributes with this pattern. So is a lot easier than having to actually you go into the code or your instrumentation trying to like create your sampler or like trying to have this environment somehow. Now you just create this object and that's it. You don't have to care about like how the SDK would do this. We are the ones that instrumenting like doing that for you. So you don't have to do it and of course has a lot of thing like I'm just trying to like put a few screenshots this can be quite big. So you can see here like oh like oh I have a processor I have a batch with this schedule with this time out my exporter is this type and is a good one that we have a file called like kitchen sync on that repo that every single like spec that is created is added to this file which is the one that I'm showing here. So if you want to see examples of everything you have here and it has the comments of what it means, what are the values, what are like the default values if you don't put them. So is a great one and we also have one for migration. If you're like I just want the basic because I'm using my environment variables and I don't want to have to like copy. So you just copy that file and it's still going to use your environment variables for some basic stuff. uh if you want to know what is available today. So we have uh this matrix of compliance which Java is fully compliant PHP uh JavaScript is partially and we do have a lot of other languages that are also working on it. uh I think they we just need to update this for a few of them like for example go uh and I believe Python are also have some implementation and when I say like it's fully compliant does not mean that it's ended is like complete that is not what it means there are still features that still needs to be added but at least the basic of what you're seeing here is is working for those languages uh and here I can probably copy this on the chat and we can share but here I put it a few links for resources. So the blog post that I mentioned which is in English and in Portuguese. So that is like see one of the cool things about localization that I already created like both of them. Uh I have the the file like the repo for the configuration and the examples that I mentioned. So the kitchen sync the migration itself and if you have question about the config file in general you can use the the select channel. So the hotel config file if you want to have specific for the SDK. So for example, how this is working on the Java one or the JavaScript one. So then you go to those specifics uh channels. So like hotel Java, JavaScript go and so on. And yeah, that's what I have for an overview for today. >> This is great. Now I I had a follow-up question for you, Manidia. Um so these configurations, it sounds like they are um language dependent. So you do them you do them at the language level not at the collector level. Is that correct? >> So the so one thing is supposed to be like completely agnostic. So you can use the same file doesn't matter which SDK you're using. Uh but there are parts that are also for the collector. So for example the collector is already using the clarative config for a couple of things >> right? >> So is is pretty much like already added there. uh I don't have a list with me easily to just show what are the things that are working but the idea is to have like all components will be able to have the craft config is just a matter of now we need to go and implement on all those places >> but does like how does how does the config file get loaded up does it get loaded like as part of yeah I I guess I I'm having trouble like understanding where in the flow it it fits in >> is you're talking specifically about the collector or in general. >> Oh no, just the just in general like the the like the declarative uh config like for the environment variables. >> So for example, I can talk about like the JavaScript which is the one that I'm working on. So when you initialize the SDK usually you do like for example new SDK and sometime you have to like pass parameter. >> This time you're not going to you don't need to do this. So your file is going to exist on the same place that you're adding your instrumentation. Uh >> so it picks it up from does it pick it up like from as long as you have that file in a particular directory in your code it'll pick it up. Is that the idea? >> Yeah. So yeah because the because the environment variable it points to the file. So as long as you put the like this is the path to the file. So when you initialize the SDK it's going to check like does this do you have set a config file? If you don't, it's gonna ignore and use whatever you were doing before. But if it has, it's gonna say, "Okay, let me check what you have on that file." And for some things, it's pretty much saying like if you have this f value, I'm going to use otherwise it have default values for a lot of things. So it's basically that is the moment when you initialize like the SDK that is going to read and do whatever it needs to do. >> Okay. Okay, that makes a lot of sense. This is cool because I guess it also lets you um I I I guess if you're using like just the old way of like just the environment variables that was very flat, right? And this kind of gives it a little bit more structure too. So it kind of lets you like lump configurations together which is very cool. >> Yeah, because we have a session for example this works for everybody. So it's supposed to be like very like agnostic. So ah now my application is in Python IP like use the same. But of course there are things that are very specific for languages like this like agents only exist in Java. So but oh but I still want to configure this. So the config file has sessions for languages as well. So if you have like this is specific for Java do this. We have those type of things there as well. >> That's awesome. Reese, do you have anything uh that you wanted to chime in on? I'm still processing. >> It's so cool, right? Like my mind is blown. I'm like where were you like five years ago? >> Yeah. Yeah. And the idea is even like for some of the things you don't have to like restart some of components and can just like read as is. So it's also that is an advantage as well. But yeah. Well, I think we are can get right into some Q&A because I do have questions and I think our audience has some questions. Um, so Lisa, we would love to bring you on. >> Hi Lisa. >> All right, thank you so much. Hello everybody. I'm Lisa Jung, a staff developer advocate at Graphana Labs. I'm part of the communications and the enduser sake. So yeah now we are um gathering questions from the audience and asking our lovely feature speakers here. So the first question is from Cecil. So he said if you have both options environment variables or the configuration in a project which one takes precedence. So if you do have the environment verb saying like this is my config file that is the one that takes precedence and it's going to use this and it's not going to use the environment variable as a backup at all. It's like it's going to ignore that unless you have your config file had the environment variable on that file. But that takes the precedent. If then if you don't have the that environment var set up then uses even if you have the file existing somewhere it doesn't know. So it's going to ignore and use environment variables. >> Gotcha. Thank you. And then we have a question from Kieran. Russ is still a four-letter word. Long way to go. Question mark >> for specific for the classical fig. I I believe this question came up during your >> Okay. So yeah it is so that is the thing like because we when we people like are creating the semantic convention and stuff they try to get like people from different like languages so you know like what's going on and then you go to your own sig and start implementing but a few of segs have very small like small group so it's hard sometimes for them to handle because they have to like reveal PRs that come in and do like releases so it's hard sometimes to do and like be able to keep up with everything's going on. The same thing like database and conventions came out a lot of SDKs still don't have implementation. So if you for example you really care about rest that is your chance to join the sik and actually be a contributor. So people are really all the materials are always happy to help and have people joining in. Uh you can say like this is something that I'm interested at and I really care about how do I start contributing and it's a way for you to be able to have things faster what you want and if your goal is to be like an approver or maintainer for small things that is going to be happen faster because your contribution is going to have a lot of weight if there are not a lot of people helping out. So that is something also to keep in mind. >> Gotcha. All right. We have a question for Severine. So what does W3C trace context L2 for tail sampling uh bring to the table? >> Yeah, I said I I I I had to to take some notes on that myself because it's like a it's a it's a very very complex topic and and I'm also not like a a sampling expert, but but I try my very best. Right. So uh we have been doing sampling and open telemetry for I think over four years now and it has been evolving and like we added a lot of good things. One of the things that we had is this trace ID ratio based sampler right um and this sampler had always like this is just me quoting straight from that blog post. always had this to-do where we said like hey all you can do safely with that is sampling on root spans right so so you had not uh a lot of good um guarantees on probability downstream right because what's happening is that like you use the trace ID as a random n-sized word like you use some part of the trace ID and then you compare it to like uh uh let's say a boundary that that's like 2 to the^ of n times the ratio. So you can think about it like um if if you take 50% it's like I don't know 128. If you have six seven six bits something like that and if the number is smaller or bigger then then it comes in or does not come in. But the big problem is that like in the trace ID until level two, there were no guarantees on how many of those bits are truly random, right? Or are maybe encoding some some some additional information, right? And and this is what uh what what has been changed in in that new standard and and open telemetry is adopting that, right? So, so you send an additional flag uh when when you use that and with that you get 56 bit of sufficient random randomness and you can use that right so and again this is me just talking from a few notes that I took from the blog post. I can highly recommend reading into that. I think if we talk about sampling, we all know that like with the amount of data that people are consuming these days with open telemetry, this this is urgently needed and and they need need a lot of good hands to to also try out those things. So so give this a look and and and yeah, try it out. >> Gotcha. And to piggyback on that, Henrik, what about consistent probabilistic sampling? Uh, I don't know. Very, very honest. Um, I I'm not exactly sure. So, so that's like um yeah, maybe um that's that's maybe a good good thing for the next round, right? Maybe invite someone from the sampling sig and have them talk about that specifically, right? It looks like there's some interest into that. >> Yeah, absolutely. So Murelia uh Fernando has a question for you. Um can I have more than one config file like a file with generate configs or another with only specific JavaScript configs? >> So the file itself is going to be one because otherwise we don't know which one takes precedence. Uh but for example if the part that I mentioned that are specifics to language is still part of the same file. So you have for example like oh like tracer exporter like resources and then there is a session that we call like you should put at the bottom that like okay now it's specific like some resources and stuff for like JavaScript for Java. So that would be the parts that you have that is specific for JavaScript. Uh at the moment there's nothing specific for JavaScript. So you wouldn't have that at the moment. But if you have things different for different applications, you need one file for each one. So this is is something like for example that you can take advantage of some things environment variable related. Imagine that you have oh is exactly the same thing but I want to have the service name different on those two. So what you do then your config file point just say like use the environment variable for this case and then you have your two environments that use the the different name. Gotcha. Another question from Henrik for Melia. Uh would the OTL operator provide a config CRD that could be deployed across Kubernetes objects? Not sure because I don't see like for example a reason to add new config because the idea is to have like all possible config that we want to exist on that file. It's just a matter of like does it exist already or something that needs to be added because it's a little more also about like getting now feedback from the community just because we have something a little more stable and say like what is missing and what we can add there. So those are the points that we need feedback from people. I can check this one specifically but from the top of my mind I don't know the answer if we have something already for this one. >> Gotcha. Um so we have a question from Cecil so please feel free to jump in Stephan or Morelia. Um is there any guidance you can share around open to labor for longunning background processes? >> Yeah I can pick that. Um so so this is actually like a a very complicated topic right and I just looked it up. There's an issue on the open telemetry specification from 2019. So since the project was founded uh by Armen around that topic and the first guidance I can give is >> um open to labor that's >> yeah no worries um um now now I lost track for a minute yeah so so um the very very first guidance I I I can give you is like um go to that uh issue to go to that repository um and call out that that you're interested in that and maybe even interested in helping with that. It's a very gnarly topic, right? Um so what can you do do until then, right? I mean at the end it depends a little bit on of what does long mean to you, right? I mean if we talk about if we talk about spans and traces talk taking a few minutes um then then then we are totally fine. you maybe should be just fine with with the tracing that you're doing today. But if you say like, hey, and this is the classic thing, right? You have a background job and maybe this is doing some video encoding and maybe you want to do something around that. One thing you definitely can do today, right, is is use is use um logging and events for that and maybe announce like those kinds of things and say like, okay, now I'm starting, now I'm ending. It it's not perfect, right? and and let's be super honest with that and there's probably a still of things you need to do on your back end of things. Um but yeah, you have to work around that and just let us know that like um we we we need to do more on that topic. So so that's the guidance here. Yeah, >> thanks everyone. All right, I need to stop just reading straight I need to process a little bit more before like reading the questions out loud. So sorry about that. Okay. So, as we uh we wrap up our Q&A, I'm gonna I'm gonna ask one question to both Sever and Amilia. So, you've been contributing to hotel for a long time. So, I'm going to take you all the way to the beginning. Um, how did you get your start in contributing to hotel? And do you have any advice for new contributors? Who goes first? You want to start or should I start? I >> You can You can start. You started first. >> Yeah. Yeah. Uh they let me get started. So my reason to start with open telemetry was a very selfish reason, right? And and this is this is something I always tell people, right? If you want to get into open source, have your own good reason to start with open source, right? have something where say like I don't know I want sampling to be better in open telemetry because like I have way too much telemetry so let me get started with sampling and then make this thing work. So, so, so my situation back then was like um I was in a consulting position, right? And I was talking with a lot of people what we back then called APM and we were still transitioning to call everything observability and people had questions about open telemetry, right? They told me like, hey, what is this thing? Should I use that or should I stick with this thing I have already? And this was like every time like something where it was like recognizing like, hey, I have to level up on that, right? So I'm I went to the community and I said like okay let me get started on that. Let me learn myself what this open telemetry thing is so that I can speak better uh to my users to our customers to people that that want to to get into our product. Um so so I started to help with documentation help us getting started. I started actually also in the JavaScript community but then I stuck with documentation because again this was the most helpful thing for myself to just explain open telemetry better to to other people. So yeah, for me it was basically I I have working on observability like a few companies before and then I really like oh I like this observability thing and I really want to focus on that. So I was like I looking for a job that that is basically my job. I only have to think about like the observability and this is why like I went to graphana that the team was like you have to contribute to hotel so that it was like oh exactly what I wanted. So this is kind of how I started contributing. So was a mix of things that I found it interest like oh I think this is important I should contribute it and a mix of what also makes sense for my own company. Uh, and I do actually have I was going to say we we just created a post that I can share here. There's like ideas on how to contribute it because if you wanted again you can have like several reason for it or like you're just working on something because your company needs or something your own personal project needs and you want to like develop is something that you just want to learn. You want to increase your network uh people that you want to meet. So pick something that or really like interested you like oh I already have knowledge and I want to like focus on that or something like oh I'm just curious about thing I don't know what is this but I want to learn can have like both ways and really like dig deep and into those ones that open tele is a huge project and like so many components so many languages you will find it's just a matter of finding what is your place there and you can try it out. There is no thing like I picked this no now I have to go through this one until the end like no join a couple of calls just listen in you don't have to say anything like oh this thing seems interesting like continue a little more other no this is not for me go to the next one until you find what is the thing that really excited you >> nice thanks Melia so Melia Severin Adriana and Ree have been amazing guides and mentors when I was first getting started by the hotel. Now we I lied there's one more burning question for both of you. So the question is what kind of interesting usage trend trends in terms of implementation observability stack docs page views or anything have you seen over the past year? I think this is more of like whatever people did not think it was necessarily important before to have observability on they're like oh yeah that would be good if I actually know what the hell was going on. So I think and then just like time people keep adding more and more. So it's a lot of old type of applications that people did not think about like oh yeah I should adding but also new things but I I guess you're going to find a little of everything like people like really now until like mobile like nobody was paying attention or like the browser one that's being really active. So it's just like what we forgot to add it okay let's work on all this thing because it's really important. So it's just like all over. So you're going to find from every single place and then even things that people do for fun like I want to monitoring the quality of the air and humidity on my plants. There are people that do this to like oh no I'm actually working at NASA and have want to know what's going on. So you're going to find so much spread. Yeah. So that is the cool thing about hotel >> 7D. >> Yeah. I can I can try to to make it quick because there's so many things I could now answer that I was just thinking about it like yeah I had like five or 10 things in my head but let me let me pick like a few like the one thing is like and and this maybe is is close to like hey let's measure like the humidity in our room. Uh I saw more more also like databases being using observability inside the database right I mean we saw like hey tracing going up down to the database but I know that like now people are thinking about like why not do tracing inside of the database right I mean that's that's like something I I found very funny similar to what I mentioned before right your docker build um so so this this is just this thing where we need to recognize like every software can be traced locked and metrics metric Is there even a verb? I don't know. Um but but I think you get the gist, right? So so you can put open telemetry into just everything and and get out out amazing data. Um and the other thing and and then I I tried to make it quick to so so that we can get to an end is like I think people start to recognize that like with OTLP they can send their data everywhere, right? I mean Adriana you wrote about that don't send your traces, logs and metrics into into different places. That's not what I'm talking about. It's more like, hey, wait a minute. I can send a bunch of my data over into that back end and I can send maybe another portion of that data into into another specific tool. And and people start to recognize like they have a lot of freedom with the data, right? They have a lot of freedom with the obser with the observability data beyond let's say what what observability vendors offer today or what we do with like trace explorers, alerting and all the capabilities that we had before. This is actually a topic I'm I'm very very curious and excited about right now that we say like wait a minute now we have all this data what else can we do with that right I think that's that's super super interesting >> thank you I yeah it has been really interesting um and thank you all so much for following along um if you have additional questions please find us at um on CNCF Slack instance at hotel-s SIG dash and dash user channel. Um there is a QR code on the screen for you to use. Um also huge shout out to Henrik Rexet um who is doing all this live streaming stuff for us on the back end. Thank you so much to Lisa for hosting our Q&A. Um Adriana for being my co-host and Sean and Maria for taking the time to come on and keep us updated. Thank you so much. Um >> yeah, thank you for having us. >> Yeah. happy to be here. >> We got a question asking when the next one is. So, um, this means that, uh, I guess we'll have to put on another one. We definitely plan on putting on another one. Um, hoping for a monthly cadence. Um, but we also have CubeCon coming up in November, so we'll see. There will be uh, speaking of CubeCon, um, as Sephron mentioned, Hotel Observatory is happening. Um, if you haven't been to the Hotel Observatory booth, it's loads of fun. This is where all the cool hotel peeps come to hang out. Um, and we're also um doing uh as part of uh uh a thing that we've been doing the last little while for CubeCon, we're doing a live stream um from CubeCon. And I guess it'll be uh we call it the humans of hotel liveream. I guess it will be to a certain extent a what's a what's new in hotel. So uh keep an eye out for that. I believe it's happening on the Wednesday. Let me just double check. Uh Wednesday, November 12th from uh starting at 2:30 p.m. Eastern time. So, keep an eye out for that. And um I think that's it. Uh do you have anything else, Ree, to add to that? No, I thank you all for being here. >> Yeah, thank you. And also if you have a cool you uh hotel story to share um whether it's like how you use hotel in your organization or you have like a presentation that you want to do about cool stuff you've done with hotel reach out to us in the hotel and user sig again it's hotel- sig-end user on Slack we would love to hear from you. >> Yes. Thank you so much everyone. We'll see you next time. >> Thank you everyone. >> Bye.
