## Summary

In this video, the speaker discusses the importance of internal teams being involved in building their own observability dashboards and alert systems. They argue that if external teams are responsible for these tasks, the alerts and dashboards will lack specificity and relevance, leading to delayed responses to incidents. The speaker emphasizes that an internal team’s familiarity with their products and code allows them to create more tailored and effective monitoring tools. Overall, the video highlights the necessity of team involvement in incident response systems to ensure timely and accurate reactions to potential issues.

[00:00:10] **Speaker:** foreign ERS were not involved in the part of building their own dashboard, building their own alert, knowing what data they're sending for their observability reasons.

If I was the one making the alerting for them, it would be something extremely generic with some thresholds that I just thought would be right because I don't know their products or their code. Obviously, the dashboards would be completely generic, but if those were done by a person inside the team itself, it would be so easy for them.
