## Summary

In this video, the speaker discusses the importance of internal team involvement in creating dashboards and alerts for observability in software development. The speaker argues that if external resources (ERS) handle these tasks, the alerts and dashboards may be too generic and not tailored to the specific products or code of the team, potentially leading to delayed incident responses. The emphasis is on the need for team members to build their own tools to ensure they are relevant and effective.

**Speaker:** Foreign ERS were not involved in the part of building their own dashboard, building their own alert, knowing what data they're sending for their observability reasons. They will not be able to respond to an incident in time. Simple as that. If I was the one making the alerting for them, it would be something extremely generic with some thresholds that I just thought would be right because I don't know their products or their code. Obviously, the dashboards would be completely generic, but if those were done by a person inside the team itself, it would be so easy for them.
