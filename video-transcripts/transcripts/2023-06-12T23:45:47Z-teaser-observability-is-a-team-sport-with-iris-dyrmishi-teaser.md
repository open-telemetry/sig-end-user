## Summary

In this video, the speaker discusses the importance of involving team members in the creation of their own dashboards and alert systems for effective observability. They emphasize that without team involvement, alerts would be overly generic and potentially ineffective, as the creator wouldn't have the necessary context about the products or code. The speaker argues that if team members handle the development of these tools, they would be more tailored and responsive, allowing for quicker incident response. Overall, the video underscores the significance of team ownership in observability processes.

Foreign ERs were not involved in building their own dashboards or alerts, which means they don't know what data they're sending for their observability needs. As a result, they won't be able to respond to an incident in time. 

If I were the one creating the alerts for them, I would have to make them extremely generic with some thresholds that I thought might be appropriate, since I don't know their products or their code. Consequently, the dashboards would also be completely generic. 

However, if those dashboards and alerts were created by someone within the team, it would be much easier for them to manage and respond effectively.

foreign ERS were not involved in the part of building their own dashboard building their own alert knowing what data they're sending for their observability uh reasons they will not be able to respond to an incident in time simple as that if I was the one making the alerting for them it would be something extremely generic with some thresholds that I just thought would be right because I don't know their products or their code obviously the dashboards would be completely generic but if those were done by a person inside the team itself it would be so easy for them
