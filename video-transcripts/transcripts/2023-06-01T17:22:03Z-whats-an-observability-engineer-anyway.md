## Summary

In this video, the speaker discusses the role of OpenTelemetry in providing documentation and guidelines for manual instrumentation. They emphasize the importance of collaboration with engineers, stating that while the engineers are skilled in their own code, the sessions aim to share best practices and introduce tools available for their use. The speaker highlights that the process is a team effort, encouraging engineers to utilize the resources provided.

### [00:00:00] Introductions

**Speaker:** Thank you. We provide documentation. We provide guidelines, and there is a lot of very good documentation in the OpenTelemetry as well about manual instrumentation. 

### [00:00:30] Best practices introduction

Basically, we have sessions with engineers, not to train them because I think they can do it better than we can because it's their code, but just to show the best practices and to introduce them to that. We tell them that, hey, our tools are here for you, and they take it from there. It's a team sport, let's say. Thank you.
