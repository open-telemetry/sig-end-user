## Summary

In this video, the speaker discusses the importance of providing documentation and guidelines for engineers regarding manual instrumentation in OpenTelemetry. They emphasize that while they are not training engineers, they facilitate sessions to showcase best practices and introduce the tools available to them. The speaker highlights the collaborative nature of the process, suggesting that it is a "team sport" where engineers can effectively utilize the tools and resources to enhance their work.

## Chapters

00:00:00 Welcome and intro
00:00:10 Documentation and guidelines
00:00:20 Manual instrumentation overview
00:00:30 Best practices introduction
00:00:40 Tools and teamwork
00:00:53 Closing remarks

[00:00:10] **Speaker:** Thank you. We provide documentation. We provide guidelines, and there is a lot of very good documentation in the OpenTelemetry as well about manual instrumentation. 

[00:00:30] So basically, we have sessions with engineers, not to train them because I think they can do it better than we can because it's their code, but just to show the best practices and to introduce them to that and to tell them that, hey, our tools are here for you. 

[00:00:40] They take it from there. It's a team sport, let's say. Thank you.
