Thank you. We provide documentation and guidelines, and there is a lot of very good information in OpenTelemetry regarding manual instrumentation. 

Basically, we have sessions with engineers—not to train them, because I believe they can do it better than we can since it's their code—but to show them best practices and introduce them to our tools. We want to convey that our tools are here for them, and from there, it's a team sport, let's say. 

Thank you.

thank you we provide documentations we provide guidelines and there is a lot of very good documentations in the open Telemetry as well about manual instrumentation so basically we have sessions with Engineers uh not to train them because I think they can do it better than we can because it's their their code but just to show the best practices and to introduce them to that and to tell them that hey our tools are are here for you and it they take it from there it's a team sport let's say thank you
