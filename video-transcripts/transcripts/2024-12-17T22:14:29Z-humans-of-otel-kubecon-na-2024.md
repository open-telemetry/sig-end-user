[00:02:00] **Reese:** Hi, my name is Reese Lee and I am a Senior Developer Relations Engineer at New Relic. OpenTelemetry. I got into the project sort of almost accidentally, although I think at this point that's an answer that I give for everything. When I mean accidentally, it was I was looking for answers to questions that I had and more importantly, how do I teach other people to find answers to questions better and how do I continue to level up the teams that I worked with, the organizations that I worked with and in figuring out how to get people better at asking questions, getting answers, and learning from that? I finally stumbled onto OpenTelemetry.

In March, I entered an internship called Outreachy and in Outreachy I was privileged to work on OpenTelemetry and I worked on building a logging bridge in Golang, and by the end of the internship I was able to build a logging bridge using OTel zerolog.

How did I get involved with OpenTelemetry? This is a multi parter question or answer, I think in this case, because there were a couple of reasons why it caught my attention. Starting off with actually advocacy from our new group product manager who had recently joined and she was a big proponent of observability and OpenTelemetry specifically. I kind of had played around with OpenTracing and OpenCensus for a little while, but I hadn't really looked into OpenTelemetry. But once she came in I was a huge advocate for it and that got my attention. That was trigger number one. 

Trigger number two was the fact that it was this open standard. So I think anything open standards to me is a no brainer. I've got a lot of time to invest in any sort of open standard that makes life easy. I think from a flexibility standpoint that's the way to go. So that was trigger number two. 

Trigger number three was actually when we started using OpenTelemetry. So we are an API management platform at Tyk. For us, OpenTelemetry was being used internally as well as externally. So internally we could already start seeing results in terms of how quickly and efficiently we were getting to troubleshoot problems and getting to the heart of issues. And not just limited to REST APIs but actually with GraphQL APIs as well, which you wouldn't have considered as a possible use case. But we were able to remediate some of those issues that we were facing with that. So that was sort of trigger number three. 

And all of that collectively came together to say, hey, OpenTelemetry deserves attention. Initially I started as a product manager. It was a very interesting role because I started in a role where it was more about coordination rather than contributing directly. But I've been recently involved in the localization of the documentation. So that means translating the documentation, more specifically in my case among Spanish speakers. So, la traducción de la telemetria abierta. So, the traduction...the translation into the Spanish of the OpenTelemetry documentation. 

[00:04:50] At my previous role, my manager at the time, as part of it, he encouraged me to actually join the OpenTelemetry community. And it was actually my first time ever contributing to open source and I never contributed to open source. I've been in tech for like over 20 years and my manager basically said, yeah, just attend a couple meetings. And my first meeting was for the OTel comms. And so that was kind of my gateway into OpenTelemetry.

I started my career in embedded applications and I was doing eBPF tracing before that was even a thing. I then moved into Dropbox where all our telemetry was in-house before OpenTelemetry was mainstream and now on Monday I continue doing trace-based testing. I started to learn about OpenTelemetry. I realized that this is such an opportunity for the whole industry to actually commoditize and standardize how instrumentation is being done and to be able to use common semantic conventions so people can understand what's going on. So I got instantly excited and I started to work on it. 

First it was just a few test applications, then I played with and demoed to people on how to do instrumentation. But as we started our current company, from day one I said we have to make sure that we are properly instrumenting our software so that we can actually operate this as we get more customers for logs, metrics and disability testing, it has been helping us a lot.

I got involved in OpenTelemetry because our team uses OpenTelemetry, namely the OpenTelemetry Collector, to support our customers collecting data off of their environments. When we had bugs and issues with OpenTelemetry in the past, there would be some light involvement from the team, but largely we would open an issue and sort of wait for it to get addressed. And I really wanted to change that within the group. And I wasn't the only one on our team who wanted to change that. So, you know, we all sort of started to make a more genuine effort to open issues that came with PRs. And that has generally moved our whole team forward into being more involved in OTel. 

And I've ended up being much more involved in OTel to the point where now I'm a code owner on the Host Metrics Receiver, which is an important receiver to us, but I get to dedicate more time to making sure it's good for everyone and not just fixing our own problem.

I was originally asked to contribute to the OpenTelemetry by helping with the Elastic Common Schema donation to the OpenTelemetry, specifically to the specification and the semantic conventions. And since then I have been more and more involved in other projects like the Collector. And right now I'm mainly focusing on the semantic conventions and the OpenTelemetry Collector, specifically the Collector contrib project.

[00:07:42] The way I got involved in OpenTelemetry was at New Relic. And at first my first experience with it was through some support tickets that we started to get around some of our customers who had adopted OpenTelemetry. And then I had a great opportunity to join our dedicated OpenTelemetry team at the time as a developer relations engineer. And this was back in November 2021. And I was able to integrate within the OpenTelemetry community pretty soon after that. And actually my previous manager, Sharr Creeden, she kind of spearheaded the work to build the End User Working Group at the time, and now we are the End User SIG.

OpenTelemetry has been really useful at my organizations that I've worked on because it's become something that you can tie into different vendors, tie into different tools, and into other intermediary ways. And the huge benefit of it for me is that I can take all these different bits of knowledge, not necessarily signals, but different bits of context from the company, tie it all together in a way that I can show people these answers to their questions, regardless of whether or not they're in engineering. And that is a new capability because previously engineering was kind of in its own bubble and increasingly it really can't continue to do that. 

And so OpenTelemetry has been super impactful for me for bringing our knowledge outside of engineering and bringing the outside knowledge into engineering. Things have become a lot more efficient internally. When I talk to our SRE teams, our DevOps teams, they're a lot happier when they're interacting or working with different elements of our platform stack. It's a lot easier to manage and handle it. Now when I talk about the end users, they can truly talk about the value of it. 

And personally, I think just the advocacy side of things, I think has been really, really enriching for me to learn more about it. Being involved with the community in different ways. Earlier this year I had the privilege of putting together a mini conference called LEAP, which was the API Observability Conference, where a lot of the folks from the community were able to scroll, speak to the different areas and elements of OpenTelemetry, not just limited to, again, the engineering side of things, but also how decision makers could perceive the value of adopting something like OpenTelemetry within their organization.

[00:10:30] It all started when Elastic, we decided to donate the Elastic Common Schema, which was a natural fit to the goals of OpenTelemetry, or standardizing observability and driving efficiency across getting telemetry data converged into a single standard. When I just started my career, there was no OpenTelemetry, so I had to figure out how to do traces and how to correlate them with metrics and how to do logs. But now all this effort has already been standardized by the community, so new engineers that are onboarding into OpenTelemetry have a much easier time than I have. 

In general, I think that the ability to be able to take signals from your application and to be able to use them to operate the environment to understand the behavior of the system is significantly easier with OpenTelemetry than it was with other proprietary instrumentations in the past. What I think is more interesting is what do you do with this data? Most of this information is being exposed to people in dashboards which are amazingly nicely presented, contextualized based on semantic conventions. 

But I think that the biggest advantage is to be able to use software to reasonably data. The main way OpenTelemetry has helped me personally is really learning how to interact with a large community. I already had some experience with open source communities and there is this sort of general culture of like, you know, you do the work, you get a say in the project. That's pretty common in the open source world and I think that's fine. 

But OpenTelemetry has a very large... I really like working with the OpenTelemetry ecosystem in general because I believe that working with people from other companies, other teams, helps me personally as an engineer a lot because I see how other people do observability out there. So I keep learning a lot. So that's something that I really like and I believe in general my team is also really helped by this, by this fact and also for my job. I mean it's amazing because I really love open source, I really love working with open source projects. And yeah, I think that on a personal level it's really helpful.

OpenTelemetry has helped me personally in honestly really big way, in the sense that working in developer relations with OpenTelemetry, I've gotten to meet a lot of wonderful people which I talked about earlier. But as part of my role I get to submit topics to different events and part of that is being able to learn about all these different topics myself and being able to talk to people who are using it in production or trying it on themselves has been a really wonderful experience.

[00:14:00] My definition of observability, it is the process through which one develops the ability to ask meaningful questions, get useful answers and then act effectively on when you learn. So what I mean by that is it's not enough to be able to kind of figure out the answer. There's this process where you have to actually work on it over and over and over and you're developing a skill not just on a personal level, but on an organization level, on a group level, and in even broader an industry level. So as you continue to do that, continue to get those really, really useful answers and really, really meaningful questions that you can ask. You start to have this whole process of group learning that transcends the boundaries that we draw for ourselves and lets those boundaries become empowering rather than limiting.

Observability Engineers are like the doctors of your system. So if something is going wrong in your system, you need us to be able to pinpoint where exactly or what exactly is wrong and how to solve whatever is wrong. So that's what observability means to me. 

What does observability mean to me? There is a technical answer to this, where it goes into the realm of perhaps monitoring, perhaps logging, and, you know, getting to the troubleshooting of all things. To me, it's all about understanding. It is essentially understanding the pulse of your platform that you have created. I work with APIs quite a lot, so everything underlying is all to do with API platforms. 

So understanding the pulse of your API platform, the different components coming together and knowing exactly what's functioning, not functioning, the good, bad and ugly of it all, that, to me, is what observability is all about. So to be able to get to that part of the problem, to be able to know what's working, what's not working, and making decisions more effectively. 

Monitoring means knowing answers to questions that you know you needed to ask. Observability means knowing questions to answers that you didn't know that you need to ask. To me, observability means the ability to get insights into your system. And for me, like, this was extremely transformative, because, like, there's so many times in my life where, you know, I was debugging code, whether it was like my own code, like, as a developer or code in production, and not understanding, like, just looking through logs and not understanding, like, okay, but how does this relate to the bigger picture? 

Like, I have so many memories of troubleshooting production issues, and it's like, oh, the system is slow. So you ask the person who's responsible for administering the app server, hey, can you check the logs? No, not my problem. You ask the DBA, no, no, it's not my problem. And then you ask whoever else, and you go down the whole line and, like, it's nobody's problem. And yet you're still seeing latency. And I feel like observability kind of like it. It uncloaks the whole thing because all of a sudden it exposes. Like, it exposes where the actual root cause is. And I think that's the magic and power of observability.

The most important thing in software engineering today is the user experience. And because our software is getting much more complex, it's getting harder to answer the question, how are my users experiencing my product? And OpenTelemetry allows us to answer these difficult questions and provide us with visibility into our software. 

[00:17:30] I think that probably the most obvious answer is to be able to collect signals. But I think that the real point of observability is to understand and reason about the behavior of the systems. Simply collecting data doesn't actually accomplish much. I think also with the becomes meaningful and valuable, and people are able to use this to drive actions, to drive decisions. Where do I need to improve reliability? Where do I need to improve the performance of my application? Where do I need to make architectural changes? I think observability is really serving that. Otherwise it's just a lake of data.

Observability means to me that you can tell what's going on. Computers are black boxes that understand what ones and zeros do. And being able as a human to understand what ones and zeros are doing at any given time, when a computer is blazing so fast, how would you ever be able to figure out what that means? So observability to me is the human version of understanding what a computer is doing. 

So for me, observability is something that I have been working on since university, and it's a really important area because I think that what really matters when we are running systems, it's the way that you can observe your systems, you can know if your systems are doing good or not. And specifically, I'm coming from an infrastructure background, as I mentioned before. So for infrastructure specifically, it's really, really important when it comes to cost reduction. And this sort of stuff or how the whole system is working is an important piece that you cannot miss.

Observability to me means that I, as an end user of various applications and software programs, get to have a better experience because the companies that build these products, you know, assuming that they're using observability and being able to stay on top of issues that are happening in their code, it means I get to have a better experience as an end user.

[00:20:00] OpenTelemetry to me is one really interesting approach towards building something that takes a very sort of capitalistic notion of companies need to be profitable, companies wanting to innovate, people wanting to compete, and people want to develop different solutions to things. And how do you wrap all that together in a project that's flexible enough to allow that competition, to allow those ideas to happen, and to allow this innovation to continue without limiting what's possible and without burdening the industry with the intermediate details of the evolution of that complex, the evolution of pursuing excellence. 

OpenTelemetry is, I believe, the future of observability. In March, when I started doing research on OpenTelemetry, I discovered how big this can be and I decided that I was going to go in fully into OpenTelemetry. So I believe that it's the future of observability and everyone should take it.

What does OpenTelemetry mean? To me that's an extension of that understanding. In a way it's the... Well, again, the technical answer to this would be, is the open standard that essentially powers distributed tracing. That's all fine. To me it's the extension of that understanding by creating a common language or framework, however you want to put it, that the different components and elements of your platform stack can unite together to speak to the health of your overall platform. 

And that could go from the engineering standpoint all the way to the business standpoint. There are repercussions to both of those. So to me that's what OpenTelemetry as a technology brings, both from a business and a technical standpoint. But it's also about the community as well. It's sort of again the industry coming together and agreeing on a standard so that the life of SRE, DevOps organizations, tooling providers, end users, all of their lives are made a lot easier because by virtue of having an open standard, it means that your platform is a lot more flexible, you have a lot more freedom to evolve, to mature and actually be a bit more future ready. 

So that to me is the promise of flexibility and freedom that OpenTelemetry brings. For me it means a common language. So it's a place where we all, where users can made and at least understand that everything that we are going to collect is going to be collected in a similar way, with a similar mechanism. Also what we call things. So the semantic conventions we agree on common standards of what we are going to call things. So the telemetry is the same and it can be reusable. 

So yeah, so that's OpenTelemetry for me. What does OpenTelemetry mean to me? To me, you know, it feels like home actually, because it's been like my home for the last like two and a half years. So it's been like really transformative in my life because it's like I said, was my gateway into like open source, into the CNCF community. And so it takes on like a very personal flavor for me, just beyond like the, you know, the typical definition of OpenTelemetry, which is like this open standard for instrumenting your code. For me, it's just so much more than that. 

[00:23:00] It really is like this lovely community where we're working with different vendors from across the board and we're not enemies, we're all friends because we're working towards the same goal. OpenTelemetry is basically a way to standardize all the efforts, all the engineers that want to ask all the difficult questions about software. OpenTelemetry gives a way for multiple vendors to work together, to collaborate together and take the instrumentation as a given that is not a function of competition and really focus on adding value on how this information turns into an actionable insight. 

And I think that that is really where people, vendors, end users are expecting to innovate in. So OpenTelemetry is basically the enabler for vendors to focus on where the real value is. OpenTelemetry to me is a representation of the industry coming together and understanding, you know, what are we competing about really? Like what are, where are we really as different companies trying to fit in the market? 

And I think we all sort of collectively understand that the signals themselves really aren't worth differentiating on. It's generally a net negative for everyone for us to not agree on this stuff. And if we can agree on the signal part, it just leaves everyone, all companies, more time to differentiate in the ways that are actually tangible in terms of how the data works. 

Having been involved in OpenTelemetry over the past year, I think that OpenTelemetry is a great place to learn things and meet other people that are really passionate about the whole observability area. And I think that consists of people that really like what they are doing and they are really good at this. So it's a great place for engineers to come together and work and share the observability space to evolve.

OpenTelemetry to me means a lot of things, you know, beyond the project and kind of the way it's helped different organizations, you know, move into and adopt open source throughout their stack. It's also such a huge, wonderful community. I really enjoy meeting the maintainers and getting to know the end users. I have really good relationships with a lot of the OpenTelemetry community people and that's what it means to me.

[00:25:22] My favorite OpenTelemetry signal. I'm going to cheat a little bit here and I'm going to say my favorite OpenTelemetry signal is the one that gives people the answer that they find most useful for the question that they find most meaningful. 

Traces. Traces are my favorite signal because, like, they give a full, you know, a full picture of everything going on in the system and you can easily spot on errors. 

Favorite OpenTelemetry signal. This is a tough one. I think traces has to take the win at this point of time because again, just thinking about how things connect well. I'm also very, very keenly pursuing profiling. I think that's going to be potentially the winner in the next conversation we have because I think performance is a big area for a lot of organizations and especially when, as an API gateway, when we are working with different components, we have one part of the API platform stack to know if there are potential bottlenecks. 

Are we a bottleneck? Are there other elements that are potential bottlenecks there? How do we improve performance? How do we actually put our money where the numbers are, essentially? That's what profiling again, sort of promises to a point? 

Because of the background, Elastic, I gotta say logs. But of course, you know, it's... The logs are, you know, they bring like deep contextual insights, but at the end of the day, you need them all. Like metrics are gonna let us know there is a problem. Tracing is gonna help us to understand where the problem is, and logs are gonna help us understand what the problem is.

My favorite signal is traces because I fell in love with observability and OpenTelemetry because of traces. I would have to say that I got the most value out of tracing. But recently I started to correlate traces with metrics, and I think that is like the golden flow. 

I have been a huge fan of distributed tracing in general. I think it gives you the understanding of how big, like, services interact with each other. But I've been growing to like profiling. I think it gives interesting, exciting opportunities on how people understand even deeper how their systems behave, especially how their systems behave under different flow, different conditions, and to be able to adjust, improve their architectures and the scale of their systems to cater to future loads. 

My favorite OpenTelemetry signal right now is logs, because even though I'm fully immersed in OpenTelemetry now and I know what all three of the signals mean, I started on logs because logs are easy. It just makes so much sense and I understand where people are coming from, coming from with observability, second wave, you know, everything should just be trace or lot wide events. I understand the value of that, but I just feel like logs aren't ever going away.

My favorite signal coming from an infrastructure and systems background. I really like metrics, and this is something that actually is my personal goal for the next months. Coming to help a lot stabilizing metrics like system metrics in the semantic conventions and Kubernetes metrics as well, and make the collector providing more confidence to our users because having the semantic stable, that will help us.

My favorite signal. You know, I want to say traces, because they were kind of the first thing I learned when I got into the world of observability to begin with, and I think that was kind of what my mind understood. And I really like the trace waterfalls, so I'll go with that.

Things have become a lot more efficient internally. When I talk to our SRE teams, our DevOps teams, they're a lot happier when they're interacting or working with different elements of our platform stack. It's a lot easier to manage and handle it. Now when I talk about the end users, they can truly talk about the value of it. And personally, I think just the advocacy side of things, I think has been really, really enriching for me to learn more about it. Being involved with the community in different ways. Earlier this year I had the privilege of putting together a mini conference called LEAP, which was the API Observability Conference, where a lot of the folks from the community were able to scroll, speak to the different areas and elements of OpenTelemetry, not just limited to, again, the engineering side of things, but also how decision makers could perceive the value of adopting something like OpenTelemetry within their organization. It all started when Elastic, we decided to donate the Elastic Common Schema, which was a natural fit to the goals of OpenTelemetry, or standardizing observability and driving efficiency across getting telemetry data converged into a single standard. When I just started my career, there was no OpenTelemetry, so I had to figure out how to do traces and how to correlate them with metrics and how to do logs. But now all this effort has already been standardized by the community, so new engineers that are onboarding into OpenTelemetry have a much easier time than I have. In general, I think that the ability to be able to take signals from your application and to be able to use them to operate the environment to understand the behavior of the system is significantly easier with OpenTelemetry than it was with other proprietary instrumentations in the past. What I think is more interesting is what do you do with this data? Is most of this information is being exposed to people in dashboards which are amazingly nicely presented, contextualized based on semantic conventions. But I think that the biggest advantage is to be able to use software to reasonably data. The main way OpenTelemetry has helped me personally is really learning how to interact with a large community. I already had some experience with open source communities and there is this sort of general culture of like, you know, you do the work, you get a say in the project. That's pretty common in the open source world and I think that's fine. But OpenTelemetry has a very large I really like working with the OpenTelemetry ecosystem in general because I believe that working with people from other companies, other teams, helps me personally as an engineer a lot because I see how other people do observability out there. So I keep learning a lot. So that's something that I really like and I believe in general my team is also really helped by this, by this fact and also for my job. I mean it's amazing because I really love open source, I really love working with open source projects. And yeah, I think that on a personal level it's really helpful. OpenTelemetry has helped me personally in honestly really big way, in the sense that working in developer relations with OpenTelemetry, I've gotten to meet a lot of wonderful people which I talked about earlier. But as part of my role I get to submit topics to different events and part of that is being able to learn about all these different topics myself and being able to talk to people who are using in production or trying it on themselves has been a really wonderful experience. My definition of observability, it is the process through which one develops the ability to ask meaningful questions, get useful answers and then act effectively on when you learn. So what I mean by that is it's not enough to be able to kind of figure out the answer. There's this process where you have to actually work on it over and over and over and you're developing a skill not just on a personal level, but on an organization level, on a group level, and in even broader an industry level. So as you continue to do that, continue to get those really, really useful answers and really, really meaningful questions that you can ask. You start to have this whole process of group learning that transcends the boundaries that we draw for ourselves and lets those boundaries become empowering rather than limiting. Observability Engineers are like the doctors of your system. So if something is going wrong in your system, you need us to be able to pinpoint where exactly or what exactly is wrong and how to solve whatever is wrong. So that's what observability means to me. What does observability mean to me? There is a technical answer to this, where it goes into the realm of perhaps monitoring, perhaps logging, and, you know, getting to the troubleshooting of all things. To me, it's all about understanding. It is essentially understanding the pulse of your platform that you have created. I work with APIs quite a lot, so everything underlying is all to do with API platforms. So understanding the pulse of your API platform, the different components coming together and knowing exactly what's functioning, not functioning, the good, bad and ugly of it all, that, to me, is what observability is all about. So to be able to get to that part of the problem, to be able to know what's working, what's not working, and making decisions more effectively. Monitoring means knowing answers to questions that you know you needed to ask. Observability means knowing questions to answers that you didn't know that you need to ask. To me, observability means the ability to get insights into your system. And for me, like, this was extremely transformative, because, like, there's so many times in my life where, you know, I was, like, debugging code, whether it was like my own code, like, as a developer or code in production, and not understanding, like, just looking through logs and not understanding, like, okay, but how does this relate to the bigger picture? Like, I have so many memories of, like, troubleshooting production issues, and it's like, oh, the system is slow. So you ask the person who's responsible for administering the app server, hey, can you check the logs? No, not my problem. You ask the DBA, no, no, it's not my problem. And then you ask whoever else, and you go down the whole line and, like, it's nobody's problem. And yet you're still seeing latency. And I feel like observability kind of like it. It uncloaks the whole thing because all of a sudden it exposes. Like, it exposes where the actual root cause is. And I think that's the magic and power of observability. The most important thing in software engineering today is the user experience. And because our software is getting much more complex, it's getting harder to answer the question, how are my users experiencing my product? And OpenTelemetry allows us to answer these difficult questions and provide us with visibility into our software. I think that probably the most obvious answer is to be able to collect signals. But I think that the real point of observability is to understand and reason about the behavior of the systems. Simply collecting data doesn't actually accomplish much. I think also with the becomes meaningful and valuable, and people are able to use this to drive actions, to drive decisions. Where do I need to improve reliability? Where do I need to improve the performance of my application? Where do I need to make architectural changes? I think observability is really serving that. Otherwise it's just a lake of data. Observability means to me that you can tell what's going on. Computers are black boxes that understand what ones and zeros do. And being able as a human to understand what ones and zeros are doing at any given time, when a computer is blazing so fast, how would you ever be able to figure out what that means? So observability to me is the human version of understanding what a computer is doing. So for me, observability is something that I. I have been working on since university, and it's a really important area because I think that what really matters when we are running systems, it's the way that you can observe your systems, you can know if your systems are doing good or not. And specifically, I'm coming from an infrastructure background, as I mentioned before. So for infrastructure specifically, it's really, really important when it comes to cost reduction. And this sort of stuff or how the whole system is working is an important piece that you cannot miss. Observability to me means that I, as an end user of various applications and software programs, get to have a better experience because the companies that build these products, you know, assuming that they're using observability and being able to stay on top of issues that are happening in their code, it means I get to have a better experience as an end user. OpenTelemetry to me is one really interesting approach towards building something that takes a very sort of capitalistic notion of companies need to be profitable, companies wanting to innovate, people wanting to compete, and people want to develop different solutions to things. And how do you wrap all that together in a project that's flexible enough to allow that competition, to allow those ideas to happen, and to allow this Innovation to continue without limiting what's possible and without burdening the industry with the intermediate details of the evolution of that complex, the evolution of pursuing excellence. OpenTelemetry is, I believe, the future of observability. In March, when I started doing research on OpenTelemetry, I discovered how big this can be and I decided that I was going to go in fully into OpenTelemetry. So I believe that it's the future of observability and everyone should take it. What does OpenTelemetry mean? To me that's an extension of that understanding. In a way it's the. Well, again, the technical answer to this would be, is the open standard that essentially powers distributed tracing. That's all fine. To me it's the extension of that understanding by creating a common language or framework, however you want to put it, that the different components and elements of your platform stack can unite together to speak to the health of your overall platform. And that could go from the engineering standpoint all the way to the business standpoint. There are repercussions to both of those. So to me that's what OpenTelemetry as a technology brings, both from a business and a technical standpoint. But it's also about the community as well. It's sort of again the industry coming together and agreeing on a standard so that the life of SRE, DevOps organizations, tooling providers, end users, all of their lives are made a lot more easier because by virtue of having an open standard, it means that your platform is a lot more flexible, you have a lot more freedom to evolve, to mature and actually be a bit more future ready. So that to me is the promise of flexibility and freedom that OpenTelemetry brings. For me it means a common language. So it's a place where we all, where users can made and at least understand that everything that we are going to collect is going to be collect in a similar way, with a similar mechanism. Also what we call things. So the semantic conventions we, we agree on common standards of what, what are we going to call things? So the telemetry is the same and it can be reusable. So yeah, so that's, that's OpenTelemetry for me. What does OpenTelemetry mean to me? To me, you know, it's, it feels like home actually, because it's been like my home for the last like two and a half years. So it's been like really transformative in my life because it's like I said, was my gateway into like open source, into the CNCF community. And so it takes on like a very personal flavor for me, just beyond like the, you know, the, the typical definition of OpenTelemetry, which is like this open standard for instrumenting your code. For me, it's just so much more than that. It really is like this lovely community where we're working with different vendors from across the board and we're not enemies, we're all friends because we're working towards the same goal. OpenTelemetry is basically a way to standardize all the efforts, all the engineers that want to ask all the difficult questions about software. OpenTelemetry gives a way for multiple vendors to work together, to collaborate together and take the instrumentation as a given that is not a function of competition and really focus on adding value on how this information turns into an actionable insight. And I think that that is really where people, vendors, end users are expecting to innovate in. So OpenTelemetry is basically the enabler for vendors to focus on where the real value is. OpenTelemetry to me is a representation of the industry coming together and understanding, you know, what are we competing about really? Like what are, where are we really as different companies trying to fit in the market? And I think we all sort of collectively understand that the signals themselves really aren't worth differentiating on. It's generally a net negative for everyone for us to not agree on this stuff. And if we can agree on the signal part, it just leaves everyone, all companies, more time to differentiate in the ways that, that actually are tangible in terms of how the data works. Having been involved in OpenTelemetry over the past year, I think that OpenTelemetry is a great place to learn things and meet other people that are really passionate about the whole observability area. And I think that consists of people that really like what they are doing and they are really good at this. So it's a great place for engineers to come together and work and share the observability space to evolve. OpenTelemetry to me means a lot of things, you know, beyond the project and kind of the way it's helped different organizations, you know, move into and adopt open source throughout their stack. It's also such a huge, wonderful community. I really enjoy meeting the maintainers and getting to know the end users. I have really good relationships with a lot of the OpenTelemetry community people and that's what it means to me. My favorite OpenTelemetry signal. I'm going to cheat a little bit here and I'm going to say my favorite OpenTelemetry signal is the one that gives people the answer that they find most useful for the question that they find most use meaningful. Traces. Traces are my favorite signal because, like, they give a full, you know, a full picture of everything going on in the system and you can easily spot on errors. Favorite OpenTelemetry signal. This is, this is a tough one. I think traces has to take the win at this point of time because again, just thinking about how things connect well. I'm also very, very keenly pursuing profiling. I think that's going to be potentially the winner in the next conversation we have because I think performance is a big area for a lot of organizations and especially when, as an API gateway, when we are working with different components, we have one part of the API platform stack to know if there are potential bottlenecks. Are we a bottleneck? Are there other elements that are potential bottlenecks there? How do we improve performance? How do we actually put our money where the numbers are, essentially? That's what profiling again, sort of promises to a point? Because of the background, Elastic, I gotta say logs. But of course, you know, it's. The logs are, you know, they. They bring like deep contextual insights, but at the end of the day, you need them all. Like metrics are gonna let us know there is a problem. Tracing is gonna help us to understand where the problem is, and logs are gonna help us understand what the problem is. My favorite signal is traces because I fell in love with observability and OpenTelemetry because of traces. I would have to say that I got the most value out of tracing. But recently I started to correlate traces with metrics, and I think that is like the golden flow. I have been a huge fan of distributed tracing in general. I think it gives you the understanding of how big, like, services interact with each other. But I've been growing to like profiling. I think it gives interesting, exciting opportunities on how people understand even deeper how their systems behave, especially how their systems behave under different flow, different conditions, and to be able to adjust, improve their architectures and the scale of their systems to cater to future loads. My favorite OpenTelemetry signal right now is logs, because even though I'm fully immersed in OpenTelemetry now and I know what all three of the signals mean, I started on logs because logs are easy. It just makes so much sense and I understand where people are coming from, coming from with observability, second wave, you know, everything should just be trace or lot wide events. I understand the value of that, but I just feel like logs aren't ever going away. My favorite signal coming from an infrastructure and systems background. I really like metrics, and this is something that actually is my personal goal for the next months. Coming to help a lot stabilizing metrics like system metrics in the semantic conventions and Kubernetes metrics as well, and make the collector providing more confidence to our users because having the semantic stable, that will help us. My favorite signal. You know, I want to say traces, because they were kind of the first thing I learned when I got into the world of observability to begin with, and I think that was kind of what my mind understood. And I really like the trace waterfalls, so I'll go with that.
