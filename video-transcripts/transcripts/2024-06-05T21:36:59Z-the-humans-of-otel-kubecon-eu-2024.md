### [00:00:00] Introductions

**Iris:** Well, I'm Iris Durish. I'm a senior observability engineer at Meo, and my professional life is all about observability. I build an observability platform that provides the tools for engineering teams at Meo to monitor, to observe, and get the best of their obligations.

**SE:** My name is SE Nman. I'm working at Cisco at the open source program office, and I'm a member of the open Telemetry governance committee. I'm one of the co-maintainers of the open Telemetry documentation.

**Kayla:** My name is Kayla Riel. I work for New Relic, and I'm contributing to the open Telemetry Ruby project.

**Morgan:** My name is Morgan Mlan. I'm a director of product management at Swun. I've been with open Telemetry since day one. I'm one of the co-founders of the project. I'm on the governance committee. Wow, what do I work on with open Telemetry? A bit of everything. I mean, early on, it was literally everything. I mean, myself, Ted, and various others were doing many, many jobs. More recently, I've been involved in the release of traces and then metrics 1.0, logs 1.0 last year. Right now, I'm working on profiling as well as open Telemetry expansion into Mainframe computers.

### [00:01:36] Discussion on observability

**Henrik:** My name is Henrik Reet. I am a cloud native advocate at Dan Race, and I'm passionate about observability performance. I'm trying to help the community by providing content on getting started on any solutions that out.

**Vijay:** My name is Vijay Samuel, and I help do architecture for the observability platform at eBay.

**Daniel:** I'm Daniel Gomez Blanco. I'm a principal engineer at Skyscanner and also a member of the open Telemetry community.

**Doug:** My name is Doug Odard. I'm a senior solutions architect with ServiceNow Cloud Observability, which is also formerly Lightstep. I'm also a previous customer of using open Telemetry for several years prior to that.

**Adnan:** Hey, I am Adnan. I work at TraceTest as a developer advocate, which you can guess better than me what that is. I pretty much do a bunch of everything regarding open Telemetry. I'm one of the contributors for the documentation, for the blog, and the demo.

**Ren:** My name is Ren Manuso. I work for Honeycomb IO, and I am one of the maintainers of the end user.

**Vijay:** What does observability mean to me? Observability to me is the biggest passion of my life and also my professional career. It is one of those areas that you are not very interested in when you start your career because you don't know anything about it. It's not taught in school; it's not preached by the tech communities a lot. But then you discover it, and you say, "Wow, this is amazing. We're actually making a change, and we're helping the teams make the best of their product."

### [00:03:44] Importance of OpenTelemetry

**Morgan:** I think observability is a big game changer, right? It's an evolution from what we have done, especially APM, over the last few years. I worked for a very long time at EP Dynamics, and we sold APM agents to customers. We gave them a lot of the things that observability is promising today as well. But the big change I see with observability is that it's coming down, let's say, to everybody. This is making the things that we did there available for everybody. Even more, we're moving away from this "Hey, let's add a post-compilation agent into your application" to "Yeah, let's make native observability. Let's make this a thing that developers and operations teams are using across all the organizations."

**Henrik:** To me, observability means having peace of mind. It means having something that you can rely on in order to see what happened and what went wrong. I think observability is also a way to feel more technically connected to your customers and your users so that you can see the ways that they're interacting with your software instead of just the ways that you might interact with it.

**SE:** I mean, observability to me transcends just the computing industry. It's the ability to peer into something and understand how it works, what it's doing right now, and thus if it breaks, how to fix it more quickly. Certainly, when we think of open Telemetry in this industry, what observability classically means to me is visibility to back-end infrastructure and applications. Kind of excitingly, I think it's expanding right now. With open Telemetry, we're pushing into client applications; we're pushing into mainframes.

### [00:05:20] Observability vs Monitoring

**Doug:** Usually, when people mention observability, they say, "Hey, it's about... it's a replacement of the old name monitoring." But in fact, for me, it's more than monitoring because monitoring is like you just look at something. Observability, for me, is like having enough information to understand a given situation. If you just look at metrics, then okay, you have a guess that something is going wrong, but you don't understand. Having the options to get more information, like logs, events, exceptions, traces, profiling, then at the end combine all those dimensions together, then you say, "Okay, I got it. This is my problem, and I can resolve it."

**Vijay:** What does observability mean to me? I belong to what is called the site engineering organization inside of eBay, and our goal is to make sure that we can observe everything going on in the site and ensure that we have high availability. So basically, observability means knowing if the site is running fine or not because that's why I'm there.

**Adnan:** What does observability mean to me? It's a way for us to understand what's happening within our systems because we run quite a complex system. We need to understand what goes on inside of them so we can deliver a good experience for our end users at the end of the day.

**Kayla:** Oh my God, so observability is to me... I've been a full stack developer for years, and so as we observe, I actually ended up on an incident response team doing tracking of incidents, but also trying to figure out what was wrong. It pointed out to me how much we need this, how hard it was to look at so many different screens. Observability, for me, is the way to actually see what's happening in your system. It's the pinnacle of not being up the whole night trying to figure out what went wrong. With open Telemetry and with the rise of tracing in the last couple of years, it has hit an all-time high with regards to the possibilities that we have right now. I'm just really, really happy to be part of the project. I'm also really happy that it's growing at that pace that it's growing right now, and I can't see how that's going to evolve within the next couple of years.

### [00:08:00] Observability in complex systems

**Daniel:** For me, observability is about being able to ask deeper questions of our systems, being able to demand more than just alerting on things that are emergencies, things we've seen before, but actually being able to go out into the unknown and understand how complex systems are performing.

**SE:** Open Telemetry is the tool that is making observability great again. I would say that observability is seeing the surge now that open Telemetry is becoming so popular. It's allowing centralization of telemetry signals; it's allowing semantic conventions, and it's generally helping observability teams and the engineering teams take more attention to observability and building it and making it better.

### [00:09:28] Community effort behind OpenTelemetry

**Vijay:** What does open Telemetry mean to me? I think it's the vehicle for observability. I mean, it's enabling that. I joined the open Telemetry community a few years back because I was curious about this idea to bring observability to everybody. I think we are doing a really good job. What it also means to me now is that it's an amazing community. We're at KubeCon here, and I meet so many people I just know from those digital conversations, and now I can talk to them in person. We talk a lot about open Telemetry, but we also talk a lot about other things than open Telemetry. We talk about observability, of course, about what we think about what is going to happen in a few years, and all those other things. And that's what open Telemetry means to me.

**Adnan:** Open Telemetry to me seems like it's a community effort to take the best of what's already been out there for instrumentation and collect it in one group so that everyone can benefit from it. I think that we've learned so much as different agent engineers, but there's also so much to learn from users of products themselves, and open Telemetry does a great job of bringing both people who are experts in observability and experts in languages to make something that's really great and meaningful for everyone.

**Morgan:** Open Telemetry is my baby. I put so much effort into creating this project. What does it mean to me? I mean, there's the boring answer, which is it extracts signals, metrics, traces, logs, profiles, everything else from your infrastructure, from your services, from your clients, and makes those observable, processable on the back end. But I think to a lot of us who've been in this community so long, and a lot of us like yourself and Henrik here and others who participated in the community so much, I mean, open Telemetry is also just a really nice open source community to participate in. It's a thing I just enjoy working on. I know that's abstract and kind of like a sort of squishy thing to say, but I don't know. Open Telemetry has a lot of meaning to me in many different ways, all very positive.

**Henrik:** Open Telemetry, for me, means the future because at the end, by having an open standard, we have the luxury, I would say, to have a common standard for a common format for all the solutions in the market. Having that common format for all the industry, all the vendors, and all the solutions, it will just open use cases. I think testing used to rely on feedback from users, and now with observable data, we can be so much more efficient in the way we test. We could be so much more efficient in replacing marketing tools, business analytics tools. I think it's the future. One thing that also a lot of people talk about is AI everywhere, machine learning, blah, blah, blah, blah. But I think it's the same thing as testing. I mean, Tesla, when you drive your car, takes decisions based on the sensors that you measure. If you don't have those sensors and those measurements, then you can have a smart system, but without the data, you cannot take the right decisions. I think it's an enabler also for the future implementations of modern applications.

### [00:12:16] OpenTelemetry as a standard

**Kayla:** Open Telemetry is the standard for observability going forward, and it's very important because as we have gone through the journey of observability over the past few years, we have had to hunt for open standards in Prometheus and a few others. Now, at least with ingestion and collection, it's a single standard for everyone to adopt, and I think that's pretty powerful for the long run.

**Vijay:** What does open Telemetry mean to me? I think it's bringing people together, bringing everyone together under one single language and one single way of thinking about telemetry. I think human languages are difficult enough for us to understand each other, and I think open Telemetry is bringing the technology together under one single way of thinking about telemetry, thinking about how we observe our systems.

**Adnan:** To me, open Telemetry is bringing the ability to have product teams and infrastructure teams helping their jobs make it easier and also just improve the customer experience and just make it an overall better experience to do our jobs.

**Kayla:** Open Telemetry is the future of observability. We've seen so many companies, so many vendors move to an open Telemetry first mindset. The way that you can use open Telemetry to generate and actually gather all telemetry signals with one set of libraries, with one tool, is just the way it was supposed to be. You're not locked into one vendor, one cloud provider anymore. You can do basically whatever you want, and you can use both the metric logs and traces for basically anything you want to do. So I'm really happy to see it grow.

### [00:14:24] Personal anecdotes about OpenTelemetry involvement

**Doug:** Open Telemetry is an instrumentation protocol that helps us ask more detailed questions about observability because it collects multiple signals from many flexible types of systems. Folks monitor everything from the control plane in Kubernetes all the way up to physical on-prem systems. It's a really flexible language, and it's a beautiful community of humans that came together over the pandemic to build something really special.

**Adnan:** I was working in a very fast-paced observability team, and we were maintaining a lot of tools. We really did not have conventions; we did not have centralizations, and we really were not flexible when it came to being vendor agnostic in general. So we discovered this amazing tool called open Telemetry. We said, "Okay, let's give it a try." It worked great for us, and here I am today, more than a year later, pushing the migration to open Telemetry in my second project.

**SE:** How did I get involved in open Telemetry? I mentioned that I got curious a few years ago. I was at EP Dynamics, working as a so-called domain architect. I was an expert for Node.js, Python, and a lot of those other languages. There was always this conversation around, "Hey, there's this thing now called open Telemetry. Should we not integrate this into our product?" I was like, "Okay, I want to learn more." Then I was like, "What is a good way to learn something new about an open source technology?" Well, get involved in that. I was involved in JavaScript at some point, and then at some point, I realized that if I really want to get a good view into open Telemetry, doing documentation is a good way into that. That's how I ended up being a maintainer for the documentation.

**Kayla:** I got involved in open Telemetry last spring when New Relic asked me to take a look at what the current status was of the open Telemetry Ruby project. I also work as an engineer on the New Relic Ruby agent team, and that gave me an opportunity to start to contribute to the project. I noticed that a lot of the signals for Ruby weren't yet stable, so a lot of my work so far has been going into trying to bring logs and metrics to stability.

**Doug:** I was working at Google on Google's observability products, like tracing, profiling, debugging, that whole thing. One of the challenges we had with tracing was getting data from people's applications. It was really, really hard. You need integrations of hundreds of thousands of pieces of software. No one team, no one company is going to maintain that; it's just infeasible. So we wanted to do something open source. There were other open source standards. There was one that had started, I think, roughly around the same time we were doing this, called open tracing and open census at some points. Especially amongst the more social media savvy members of the team, which I am not one of, there was some contention between those projects about where people who maintain databases and language front-end things should actually spend their integration efforts, and it was limiting the success of both projects. I was leading open census; Ted and Van and others were leading open tracing. In late 2018, early 2019, we finally sort of brought things to a head and decided to merge those into what is now called open Telemetry. That's sort of how I've been involved since then. I now work at a different company but still on the same things. That's how my journey started, and it's just grown and grown and snowballed.

**Henrik:** When I started the adventure in open Telemetry, I joined Dynatrace. Dynatrace has their vendor agent called OneAgent. I saw this movement of open Telemetry, and coming from the performance background, I looked at it and I said, "Wow, an open standard? That sounds quite exciting." Because I had a performance gig for a customer where I implemented collecting logs and processing it and putting machine learning, and I told myself at that time, "It would be so wonderful to have one common standard." Instead of doing a custom implementation, I could have something for everyone. When I looked at the definition of the project and the things behind the project, I was so excited. I said, "Oh gosh, I want to be involved in a project." That's where I started to build content to help the community get started. I used to be a developer, but I'm a bad developer for sure, so that's why I'm trying to help the project in other ways and other directions. My goal is to increase the adoption of open standards, making sure that it's being adopted everywhere so then we can move forward by flying even more exciting implementations.

**Doug:** I started a few years ago for two reasons. One, we were looking to introduce open Telemetry inside the company. At that time, open tracing and open census were converging into open Telemetry. We started evaluating open Telemetry for that, and given that we were moving into open Telemetry for tracing, I also went through the journey of migrating our metrics collection into open Telemetry. That's basically how I got involved.

**Vijay:** How did I get involved in open Telemetry? I got involved through working at Skyscanner as an end user. I was driving adoption of open standards, open Telemetry. During COVID, there was a need for simplification in how we approach infrastructure, how we collect, how we process, how we export data, and also basically to lead the adoption of open standards and that simplification. I got more involved in the community as Telemetry decided to interact with all end users and meet people that want to solve the same problems.

### [00:20:16] Future of observability with OpenTelemetry

**Adnan:** I actually, for several years in my previous position, was hired to develop observability software. I was writing my own thing; we were doing a lot of alert management and various things. It was so much work, and I thought this has got to be easy. Plus, I wanted to make sure that it could be future proof, there I use that term, but also extensible. When I discovered open Telemetry, I was just like, "Oh, thank you," because it's something that the company could carry forward, and also we didn't have to worry about storing the data as much. It's really provided a really excellent platform so that we can focus on the task at hand versus how to do the job.

**Ren:** How I got involved in the project was actually first as a customer. It was about three, close to four years ago, kind of the infancy of open Telemetry. I would go online; I would look at the documentation, or I would be in the code a lot, but I wanted to learn more. So I would go to a call, and there would be someone from Google and Microsoft and other companies. Then there was this guy from this small fintech in the US. At first, it was a little awkward, but they were so excited to have me in the call because I was an end user. It was a wonderful experience to begin that way, to realize that I could contribute to this rather than simply be a consumer of it. Then I transitioned my career into working for a vendor, and we implement these systems now for customers like myself that I was years ago. It's kind of a pay it forward, give back type of thing.

**Daniel:** How did we get involved in the open project? We started contributing more to the blog, and we started contributing a bit to the docs as well. It's just been a wholehearted effort in the team to always dedicate a few minutes of each day to check out the open project and to find a way to contribute.

**Kayla:** I got involved in the open Telemetry project. Honestly, I was working at one observability company in marketing, and they didn't see the point. They didn't want me to get involved. I really believed in open source. I'd worked at Mozilla and Wikipedia and really believed that this was the way forward from a strategic perspective. The second I could switch to a company that did let me get involved, that's what I did. Now I'm at Honeycomb, and I'm glad to say within the first three months, I became a project member and started working with the end user working group and worked to grow it into a SIG, into all the programs that it has today together with others.

**Adnan:** Tracing is my favorite signal. My favorite signal now is profiling because I think this is really closing a big gap that was missing in observability. I mentioned before that I come from the APM space. Now, for me, APM and observability, it's very hard to make a difference here. But one thing that when I talk with people using APM products right now is they're like, "Hey, where's code-level visibility with open Telemetry?" My commercial agent is giving me that line of code that is breaking something, and this is what we get with profiling. That's why I'm really excited about it.

**Kayla:** To decide a favorite signal is kind of difficult for me. I really love the power of traces. I think that traces can tell stories in ways that are very meaningful. But on the other hand, I've been so immersed in logs and trying to allow logs to have more connections to spans and traces, but I definitely have a soft spot for logs as well.

**Vijay:** I mean, I'm partial to distributed traces because that's where this project got its start. Early on, that's where a lot of the value was. No one else was really doing standardized distributed trace collection. There were some open-source examples of it attached to things like Zipkin and Jaeger, but I think the reason open Telemetry got so much traction so quickly is that it was providing that.

**Doug:** I'm also partial to logs, which we launched last year, just because I've been involved in a lot of parts of open Telemetry. But that's one where I was involved in a lot of the core specifically early on and driving that. It was really exciting to see that ship. Also, logs are just a thing that throughout my career, before working on any of this, I just get frustrated with because they're never standardized, they're slow to process, and they're expensive. Open Telemetry is going to bring a lot of changes there for the better for everyone who uses logs.

**Morgan:** And finally, I guess profiles because I'm working on that now, and it's new. When I was at Google many years ago, I launched what I think was the world's first distributed, like continuous profiling product, at least publicly available one, which was Google Cloud profiling stack profiling. They still support it; I still think it's free. It's very powerful. But profiling has always been a bit of a niche thing. I know like Splunk and other companies support it, but it's not as well known as metrics and traces. I think with open Telemetry, starting later this year, we're going to launch full support for profiles. That's really going to change things. We had customers at Google who would spend an hour with our profiler and save like 20-30% of their aggregate CPU because they found some really poorly optimized code very quickly. For more people to have that ability and speed to speed things up and for developers to actually get insight on how things work, that's super exciting. The tech has been there a long time, and open Telemetry bringing this mainstream is huge.

### [00:26:40] Favorite signals in observability

**Henrik:** When people ask me who is your favorite kid, usually I say I don't have a favorite kid. You know, all my kids are wonderful; they all have great qualities. I love traces because sometimes they help you to understand where it's slowed down. I love metrics because as a performance engineer I used to use metrics a lot. I love logs because logs at the end, there's no signal. If you just do analytics on logs, wow, you are so much more precise. I don't think I'll have a favorite signal. I'll just say that depending on what I need, I'll pick and choose. There's clearly one signal that will help me more.

**Doug:** There's one thing that I'm very eager and waiting for since Valencia: continuous profiling. I love profiling, and I think traces are great, but if there is a problem somewhere, profiling would be so much helpful. 

**Vijay:** So I think, yeah, I don't answer any questions, but I say, "Yeah, I love all the signals provided by open Telemetry."

**Kayla:** I am thoroughly biased towards metrics. I feel metrics are the most powerful signal as long as you're thinking through your instrumentation and making sure that you have the right granularity, cardinality being sent into the platform. You can do powerful, powerful things with regards to anomaly detection, machine learning, and many other things.

**Morgan:** I mean, I have to say traces because they give you the content. Traces give you the backbone correlation for all the other signals, right? But I do think that the current design of the API, the design of metrics is so powerful that I'm falling in love again with metrics because of the way that we decouple instrumentation and measurement from aggregation of those metrics. It's so powerful and so much richness to give us a way to describe our system that I'm calling back again in love.

**Henrik:** My favorite signal, I have to say, I'm partial to traces because I've been doing software development for so long. That was the first thing that really turned me on to it, especially because I know what it's like to debug. But I also know what it's like in an incident to have to focus in very quickly. So yes, traces are my favorite, but I do also like to send that trace ID and span ID into the logs now. It's kind of becoming my next favorite.

**Adnan:** My favorite signal is traces. I'm going to say traces definitely. My favorite signal is Ed Sheeran. What is my favorite signal? I mean, I work for Honeycomb, so I am constitutionally obliged to say traces are my favorite signal.

how that's going to evolve within the next couple of years for me observability is about being able to ask deeper questions of our systems being able to um demand I think more or than just alerting on things that are emergencies things we've seen before but actually being able to go out into the unknown and understand how complex systems are performing op Telemetry is the tool that is making observability great again uh I would say that observability is seeing the surge now that open Telemetry is becoming so popular it's allowing Central ation of telemeter signals it's allowing semantic conventions and it's generally helping observability teams and the engineering teams uh take more attention to the observability and building it and making it better what does open tement mean to me um I think it's the vehicle for observability right I mean it's it's enabling that and uh I I joined open telet Community a few years back because I was curious is about like this idea to bring observability to everybody um and I think we are doing a really good job and what it also means to be now is that it's an amazing Community right so we're at cucon here and I meet so many people I just know from those digit conversations and now I can talk to them in person and we talk a lot about open Telemetry but we also talk a lot about other things than open Telemetry we talk about observability of course about what we think about is going to happen in a few years and and all those other things and and that's what's open Telemetry me so open Telemetry to me seems like it's a community effort to take the best of what's already been out there for instrumentation and collect it in one group so that everyone can benefit from it I think that we've learned so much as different agent Engineers but there's also so much to learn from users of products themselves and open Telemetry does a great job of bringing both people who are you know experts in observability and experts in languages to make something it's really great and meaningful for everyone I mean open cemetry is my baby put so much effort into creating this project um what does it mean to me I mean there's the boring answer which is it extracts signals metrics traces logs profiles everything else from your infrastructure from your services from your clients makes those observable processable on the back end but I think to a lot of us who've been in this community so long and a lot of us like yourself and Henrik here and others who participated in the community so much I mean hotel is also just a really nice open source Community to participate in it's a thing I just enjoy working on uh I know that's abstract and kind of like a sort of squishy thing to say but but I don't know hotel has a lot of meaning to me in many different ways all very positive open chetry for me is uh means the future uh because at the end uh by having an open standard we have uh the luxury I would say uh to to have a common standard for common format for all the solution of the markets and and having that common formats for all the industry and all the vendors and all the solutions it will just open use cases I think testing used to rely uh on I don't know uh feedback from users and now with observable data we can be so much efficient in the way with testing uh we could be so much efficient in replacing marketing tools uh business analytics tools I think it's the future and one thing that also uh a lot of people talk about AI everywhere machine learning blah blah blah blah but I think it's the same thing as a Testa I mean Tesla when you drive your car uh it takes decisions based on the sensors that you measure and if you don't have those sensors and those measurements then you can have a smart you can have the smartest systems but without the data you canot take the right decisions so I think it's an enabler also for the future implementations of modern applications open telary is the standard for observability uh going forward uh and it's very important because as we have gone through the Journey of observability over the past few years we have had to hunt for Open Standards in Prometheus and few others uh now at least with uh ingestion and collection uh it's a single standard for everyone to adopt and I think that's uh pretty powerful uh for the long run what does open t mean to me that I think is bringing people together bringing everyone together under one single language and one single way of like thinking about Telemetry I think human languages are difficult enough for us to understand each other and I think you know open Telemetry is bringing the technology together under one single way of like thinking about tety thinking about how we observe our systems to me open Telemetry is bringing um the ability to have product teams infrastructure teams helping their jobs make it easier um and also just improve the customer experience and just make it overall a better experience to do our jobs elemetry is the I'm going to say the future of of observability we've seen so many companies so many vendors move to an open Telemetry first mindset and the way that you can use open Telemetry to to generate them to actually gather all Telemetry signals with one set of libraries with one tool is just the way it was supposed to be you're not locked into one to one vendor one cloud provider anymore you can do basically whatever you want and you can use both the metric logs and traces for basically anything you want to do so really happy to see it bro open Telemetry is a instrumentation protocol um that um helps us ask more detailed questions about observability because it collects multiple signals um from many flexible types of systems um every folks monitor everything from the control plane um in kubernetes all the way up to um physical on Prem systems it's a really flexible language and it's a beautiful community of humans that came together over the pandemic to build something really special I was working in a very fast pacing observability team and we were maintaining a lot of tools and we really did not have conventions there we did not have centralizations and we really were not flexible when it came to beend uh and vendor agnostic in general so we discovered this amazing tool called open Telemetry we said okay let's give it a try it worked great for us and here I am today uh one year later more than one year later and uh uh let's say pushing the migration to open Telemetry in my second project how how did I got involved into open tele so yeah I mentioned that so so I got curious a few years ago so I was um I was at up Dynamics working as a so-called domain architect and I was an expert for noas python and a lot of those other languages and there was always this conversation around like hey there's this thing now called open Telemetry and should we not integrate this into our product and I was like okay I want to learn more then I was like what is a good way to learn something new about an open source technology yeah get involved into that so I was involved into JavaScript at some point and then at some point I realized like yeah but if I really want to get a good view into open Telemetry doing documentation is a good way into that and that's how I ended up being a maintainer for the documentation I got involved in open Telemetry uh last spring when a New Relic asked me to take a look at what the current status was of the op Elementry Ruby project I also work as an engineer on the New Relic Ruby agent team and that gave me an opportunity to start to contribute to the project and I noticed that a lot of the signals for Ruby weren't yet stable so a lot of my work so far has been going into trying to bring logs and metrics to stability and M I was working at Google on Google's observability products like tracing profiling debugging that's whole thing uh and one of the challenges we had tracing was getting data from people's applications really really hard you need Integrations of hundreds of thousands of pieces of software no one team no one company is going to maintain that it's just infeasible uh and so we wanted to do something open source there were other open source standards there was one that had started I think roughly around the same time we were doing this called open tracing restart open census at some points uh especially amongst the more social media Savvy members of the team which I am not one of uh there was some contention between those projects uh about uh where you know people who maintain databases and langage front time things should actually spend their integration efforts uh and was limiting the success of both projects so I was leading open census Ted and Van and others were leading over tracing and uh in late 2018 early 2019 we we finally sort of brought things to a head and decided to merge those into what is now called open Slumber TR uh so that's that's sort of you know I've been involved since then I've been now I work at squ different company but still on the same of things but that's how my M started and it's just grown and grown and snowball when I started the adventure in oiv of course I joined diant TR and dant TR has their their vendor agent called one agents and uh I saw this movement of open Telemetry and coming from the performance background I looked at it and I said wow an open stereo that sounds quite exciting because I had a performance a gig for a customer where I implemented like a collecting logs and processing it and putting machine learning and I told myself at that time I said I would be so wonderful to have one common standard so then instead of doing a custom implementation I could have something for everyone and when I looked at the uh just definition of the project and and the things behind the project I was so excited I said oh gosh I want to be involved in a project and that's where I started to build content to help the community get started uh I'm I used to be a developer but I'm a bad developer for sure so that's why I'm trying to help the project in other way in other directions uh and yeah my my goal is uh increase the adoptions of the Open Standards uh making sure that it's been uh adopted everywhere so then we can move forward by fling even more exciting uh implementations I started a few years ago uh for two reasons one we were uh looking to introduce ing inside the company uh and at that time uh open tracing and open sensus was converging into open Telemetry uh we started evaluating um open Telemetry for that and given that we were moving into open Telemetry for tracing we I also uh went through the Journey of migrating our uh metrics collection uh into open Telemetry that's that's that's basically how I got uh involved how did I get involved in open I got involved through uh I work as sky scanner as an end user I was uh driving adoption of Open Standards open Telemetry uh during Co there was a a need for simplification and how we approach an infrastructure how we approach how we collect how we process how we export Le of data and also basically to um to basically lead the adoption of of uh Open Standards and that simplification as so as an ability Le I go more involved into the community as Telemetry decid to interact with all end users and meeting people that want to solve the same problems they want to find a solution that works for so M Telemetry I um actually for several years in my previous position I was hired to actually develop um observability software um I was writing my own thing uh we were doing a lot of alert management and various things it was so much work and I thought this has got to be easy plus I wanted to make sure that it could be future future proof there I use that term um but also extensible and when I discovered open Telemetry I was just like oh thank you uh because it's something that the the company could carry forward and also we didn't have to worry about storing the data um as much and so it it's really provided a really excellent platform so that we can focus on the task at hand versus how how to do the job so how I got involved in the project was actually first as a customer um I was it was about three close to four years ago kind of the infancy of open Telemetry and I would go online I would look at the documentation or I would be in the code a lot but I wanted to learn more so I would go to a s call and um there would be someone from Google and Microsoft and other companies and then there was this guy from this uh small fintech in the US and at at first it was a little awkward but they were so excited to have me in the call because they I was an end user and so it really was it was a wonderful experience to begin that way to realize that I could could contribute to this um rather than simply be a consumer of it so it was great and then I transitioned my career into working for a vendor uh and we Implement these systems now for customers like myself that I was years ago so it's it's kind of a pay forward give back type of thing how did we get involved into the open project we started contributing more to the blog with you guys started contributing a bit to the the dogs as well and yeah it's just been a wholehearted effort in the team to always kind of dedicate a few a few minutes of of each day to to check out the op project and to find a way to contribute to I got involved in the open Telemetry project honestly I was working at one observability company in marketing and um they didn't see the point they didn't want me to get involved and um the I really believed in open source I'd worked at Mozilla and Wikipedia and really believe that like this was the way forward um strategic perspective so the second I could switch to a company that did let me get involved that's what I did and now I'm at honeycomb and I'm glad to say within the first three months I Made Project member and started working with the end user working group and worked to grow it into a Sig into into all the programs that it has today together with others racing is my favorite signal my favorite signal now is profiling because I think this is really closing a big gap that was missing in observability right so I mentioned before right I come from the APM space and now for me APM observability it's very hard to to make like difference here but one thing that when I talk with people using APM products right now is they're like Hey where's code level visibility with open televis right my commercial agent is giving me that line of code that is breaking something and this is what we get with profiling and that's why I'm really really excited about it to decide a favorite signal is kind of difficult for me I really love the power of traces I think that traces can tell stories in ways that are very meaningful but on the same like on the other hand uh I've been so immersed in logs and trying to allow logs to have more connections to spans and traces but I definitely have a sof spot for logs as well uh I mean I'm partial to distributed traces because that's where this project got it start and I think early on that's where a lot of the value was no one else was really doing standardized distributed Trace collection right there were some open source examples of it attached to like zipin and jger but I think the reason open slage we got so much traction so quickly is that it was providing that I'm also partial to logs which we launched last year just because that's one where like I've been involved in a lot of parts of hotel but that's one where like I was involved in a lot of the core specific early on and driving that and so it was really exting to see that ship also logs are just a thing that throughout my career before working on any of this I just get frustrated with because they're never standardized they slow to process they're expensive hotel's going to bring a lot of changes there for the better for everyone who uses Vlogs and finally I guess profiles cuz I'm working on that now and it's new I when I was in Google many years ago I launched what I think was the world's first distributed like continuous profiling product at least publicly available one which was Google Cloud profiling stack profiling they still support it I still think it's free it's very powerful uh and but profiling has always been a bit of a niche thing like I I know like it's spunk and other companies we support it but it's not as well known as metrics and traces block I think with otel starting to later this year we're going to launch like full support for profiles that's really going to change things like I we had customers at Google who would spend an hour of our profiler and save like 20 30% of their aggre CU cuz they found some really poorly optimized code really quickly for more people to have that ability and speed to speed things up and for developers actually to get insight on how things work that's super exciting like the tech has been there a long time and hotel bringing this mainstream is huge when people ask me who is your favorite kid usually I say I don't have a favorite kid you know uh all my kids are wonderful uh they all have a h i don't know a a great thing you know out of it so I think I love traces because sometimes it help you to understand where it's slowed down I love metrics because as a performance engineer I used to use metrics a lot and I love logs because logs at the end there's no sing so if you just do analytics on logs wow you you are so much precise so I I don't think I'll have a a favorite signals I'll just say that depending on on what I needs and pick and choose there's clearly one signal that will help me more uh there's one thing that I'm I'm very eager and waiting since Valencia is continues profiling uh because it's uh I love profiling and I think traces is great but if there is a problem somewhere profiling would be so much helpful so I think uh yeah I don't answer any questions but I say yeah I love all the the signals provided by open I am thoroughly biased towards uh metrics uh I feel metrics uh are the most powerful signal uh as long as you are uh thinking through your instrumentation and making sure that you have the right granularity SL cardinality uh being sent in to the platform uh you can do powerful powerful things uh with regards to anomal detection machine learning and many other things so uh I love metrics I mean I have to say traces because they give you the content tracers give you the backbone corelation for all the other signals right but I do saying that the the current like design of the API design of metric is so powerful that I'm like falling in love again with metrics because of that way that we decouple uh instrumentation and measurement from aggregation of those metrics so powerful and so much uh richness to basically give us a way to describe our system that I'm calling back again in love mentions my favorite signal I have to say I'm arshal the traces uh because I'm I've been doing software development for so long that that was the first thing that really turned me on to it was the ability to see that um especially because I know what it's like to debug but it's also I also know what it's like in an incident to have to focus in very quickly so yes traces are my favorite uh but I do also like to send that Trace ID and and span ID into the logs now it's kind of becoming my next favorite uh my favorite singal is traces I'm going to say traces definitely uh my favorite singer is Ed sh what is my favorite signal I mean I work for honeycom so I am constitutionally obliged to say traces are my favorite signal
