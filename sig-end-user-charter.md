# SIG End User charter

## Scope

SIG End User covers vendor-neutral initiatives related to improving the 
OpenTelemetry (OTel) project as experienced by end users and increasing 
adoption of the project. It is focused on guiding project priorities based 
on end user feedback. 

This includes: 

* Managing the feedback loop between end users and project maintainers
* Partnering with project SIGs to host discussion panels and surveys for 
specific feedback
* Serving as the end user community touch point
* Producing enablement and community content 

### In scope

#### Project Prioritization 

Work with the OTel Governance Committee (GC) to define and run the processes 
to maintain an actionable feedback loop between end users and OTel maintainers 
to guide project prioritization as needed. For example: 

* Initialize and execute projects that require feedback from end users 
* Communicate with end users to drive awareness of such projects
* Track action items routed to SIGs as issues from such projects 

#### End User Community Management and Outreach

Provide an entry point to the OTel community for new and current OTel users, 
as well as a meeting point to discuss adoption, implementation, and enablement,
 including:

* Manage the [#otel-sig-end-user](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01RT3MSWGZ) channel 
* Direct end users interested in contributing to the project as appropriate 
* Identify common themes from feedback gathered in informal avenues (outside 
of feedback panels, interviews, and surveys), and direct them to the appropriate SIG
* Produce enablement and community engagement content to be shared publicly via
 the OTel blog and YouTube channel, such as the OpenTelemetry Q&A and OTel in Practice sessions

#### SIG Partnerships

Serve as a touch point for SIGs to collect end user feedback on usage and 
implementation, including:

* Host panels with end users 
* Host time-limited surveys 

### Out of scope

SIG End Userâ€™s scope does not include:

* Developing any new telemetry signals, SDKs, APIs, etc.
* Gathering end user feedback for other CNCF projects
* Any projects outside of the OTel project and community repos
* Vendor-specific projects 
* Recommendations or endorsements of specific commercial product vendors or 
cloud providers
